-The following is my current best set of directions for installing
-Octave on a Windows system using either a binary package or by
-installing from sources using the Cygwin tools.  If you already have
-Cygwin installed, you may need to update your installation of tools to
-include those mentioned below.
-
-Following these steps should give you an Octave installation that
-includes all the necessary tools for building dynamically linked
-functions (.oct files).
+Octave is now part of the normal net distribution of Cygwin, available
+from http://www.cygwin.com.  To install the Cygwin package of Octave:
 
  1. Use your favorite browser to view the page http://www.cygwin.com
 
  2. Click on the "Install or update now" link.
 
  3. A dialog should appear with the option to run the setup program
     from its current location or save it to disk.  Either will work,
     but I usually choose to save the setup program to disk so that it
     is possible to run it later to update the installation without
     having to go back to the web page using a browser.
 
  4. Run the setup program.
 
  5. Choose "Install from Internet".
 
  6. Select a root install directory.  You may choose any directory, but
-    it needs to have about 600MB available to install all the
-    necessary Cygwin tools plus build and install Octave from sources.
-    That may seem like a large disk space requirement, but remember
-    that you are getting more than just Octave, you are installing a
-    Unix-like development environment including C, C++, and Fortran
-    compilers as well.  Once Octave is installed, you can delete the
-    sources and build directory, freeing up about 250MB.
-
-    You may choose to install for just you or all users (if you have
-    permission to do so).  I would select "Unix" as the default text
-    file type (this option should be the default).
+    it needs to have enough space for Octave and all the related
+    tools.  Sorry, I don't know how much space that is at present.
 
  7. Select a local package directory.  This is a directory that the
     setup program will use to temporarily store package files before
     installing them.  It should have plenty of space (probably 70MB
     or more).  You may delete this directory once the installation is
     complete.
 
  8. Select your Internet Connection.  Probably "Direct Connection" is
     OK unless you are behind a firewall of some kind that limits your
     access to the Internet.
 
  9. Choose a download site.  One that is "near" you on the net is
     probably best.
 
-    If you want to install a binary package of Octave, also add the
-    User URL
-
-	ftp://ftp.octave.org/pub/octave/cygwin
-
-    in the dialog (there is a textbox at the bottom with an Add
-    button to the right -- enter the URL in the textbox and click
-    the Add button).
-
-10. Select packages.
-
-    Binary and Source installations:
-
-      Select the gnuplot package from the Graphics category.  The
-      gnuplot package from ftp.octave.org will give you the Windows
-      binary repackaged for Cygwin.  If you select the gnuplot package
-      from one of the Cygwin mirrors, you will get a recent 3.8 beta
-      version (pre 4.0 release).
-
-    Additional packages for binary install:
-
-      Also select the Octave packages you want from the Math category.
-
-    Additional packages for source compile and install:
-
-    The defaults are not enough to build all of Octave from sources.
-    In addition to the default set of packages, you should select the
-    following packages from the following categories:
-
-      Archive: unzip
-      Devel:   autoconf, binutils, bison, cvs, dejagnu, flex, gcc,
-               g++, g77, gperf, make
-      Text:    less, tetex, tetex-base
-      Utils:   diff, patch
-
-    Once you have made these selections, click the Next button to
-    download and install all the selected packages.  The download and
-    install may take a while depending on the speed of your computer
-    and your connection to the net.
+10. Select packages.  Choose Octave from the Math category and gnuplot
+    from the graphics category.
 
 11. Once the download and file installation is done, click Finish.  I
     usually choose to create an icon on the desktop and put an icon in
     the start menu.  After you click finish, a series of scripts will
     run, displaying some output in a terminal window.  It will take a
     few minutes.
 
-    Skip to step 17 if you are installing the binary package.
-
-12. Get the Octave sources, either from a current snapshot
-    distribution or from CVS.
-
-    You should check the web page http://www.octave.org/download.html
-    or look for the file RECOMMENDED-IS-N.NN.NN in the ftp download
-    directory to see what version is currently recommended (N.NN.NN
-    will be an actual version number, like 2.1.50).  If more recent
-    versions may be available they should be considered experimental.
-
-    The CVS sources are only recommended for people who want be
-    involved in Octave's development process and who don't mind
-    running into the occasional show-stopping bug.
-
-    Snapshot:
-
-      a. Download a copy of the current version of Octave from
-         ftp://ftp.octave.org.  You may use the command line ftp
-         client in Cygwin or a web browser.  You are looking for the
-         most recent recommended version in the pub/octave/bleeding-edge
-         directory.  At the time of this writing, it was
-         octave-2.1.50.tar.gz.  Save this file to your Cygwin home
-         directory.  This directory will usually be called something
-         like c:\cygwin\home\jwe from Windows (the precise location
-         depends on where you chose to install Cygwin).
-
-         IMPORTANT: If you use the ftp client, be sure to set the
-         binary mode for downloads by typing
-
-           binary
-
-         at the ftp prompt.
-
-      b. Unpack the source files using the command:
-
-           tar zxf octave-2.1.50.tar.gz
-
-         in the Cygwin shell.  This command will create a subdirectory
-         called octave-2.1.50 in your home directory.
-
-      c. Change your current working directory to the top-level Octave
-         source directory:
-
-           cd octave-2.1.50
-
-         then continue with step 14 below.
-
-    CVS:
-
-      a. Check out a copy of the current sources from the public CVS
-         archive by running the following commands
+12. To run Octave, start Cygwin.  This will bring up a terminal
+    window.  In that window type
 
-           cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.octave.org:/cvs login
-           cvs -z 9 -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.octave.org:/cvs checkout octave
-         
-         in the Cygwin shell.  The first command will prompt you for a
-         password; reply with anoncvs.  The checkout command will
-         create a subdirectory called octave containing the current
-         CVS version of the Octave sources.
-
-      b. Change your current working directory to the top-level Octave
-         source directory:
-
-           cd octave
-
-      c. Build the configure scripts by running the command
-
-           ./autogen.sh
-
-
-13. Configure Octave by running the command
-
-      ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static
+      startx
 
-    This command will take several minutes to run as the configure
-    script determines what features are available on your system.  You
-    need the --enable-shared option if you want to build dynamically
-    loaded functions (.oct files) later.  You may omit the
-    --disable-static option if you want to build static libraries (.a
-    files) in addition to shared libraries, but the build will take
-    about twice as long to complete.
-
-14. Build the Octave binary by running the command
-
-      make
-
-    You may see warnings from gcc saying that __cdecl is redefined or
-    that all code is position independent.  You may safely ignore
-    these warnings.
-
-15. (OPTIONAL) Run Octave's regression test suite by running the
-    command
-
-      make check
-
-    Running the tests may take a very long time, so if you are in a
-    hurry, you might want to skip this step.  At the time of this
-    writing, there are 4 "expected" failures related to the try-catch
-    and eval commands.  You may safely ignore those failures.
-
-16. Complete the installation by running the command
-
-      make install
-
-17. Try starting Octave by running the command
+    (a running X server is needed for plotting).  Running startx will
+    bring up a new window.  In that window, type
 
       octave
 
-    in the cygwin shell and then typing
+    That should present you with an Octave prompt.  Type
 
       sombrero (41)
 
-    at the Octave prompt to see if you can create a plot.
-
-18. Try to build a .oct file and run it:
+    at this prompt and a new window with the sombrero plot should appear.
 
-      cd examples
-      mkoctfile hello.cc
-      octave
-      ...
-      octave:1> hello
-      Hello, world!
-
-    If you are doing a binary package install, the examples should be
-    installed in the /usr/share/doc/octave/... XXX FIXME XXX
-
-
+13. To build .oct files (dynamically loaded functions) for Octave, you
+    will also need the octave-headers package.  Currently, due to some
+    bugs in the most recent version of the C++ compiler and libraries
+    for Cygwin, you will also need gcc and g++ 3.3 rather than 3.4.
+    You can use the setup.exe installer to select and install the
+    older version.
