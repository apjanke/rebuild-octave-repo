Document that "help OPERATOR" needs quotes around OPERATOR (bug #39349).

* help.m (help, do_list_operators): State that quotes are required.

* comma.m, paren.m, semicolon.m: Move do deprecated/ directory
from help directory.

* scripts/deprecated/module.mk: Add comma.m, paren.m, semicolon.m
to deprecated directory.

* scripts/help/module.mk: Remove comma.m, paren.m, semicolon.m
from help directory.
