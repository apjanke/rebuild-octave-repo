  ** Function handles are now aware of overloaded functions. If a function
     is overloaded, the handle determines at the time of its reference which
     function to call. A non-overloaded version does not need to exist.
 
  ** Overloading functions for built-in classes (double, int8, cell etc) is now
     compatible with Matlab.
 
+ ** Performance of concatenation (using []) and the functions cat, horzcat and
+    vertcat has been improved for multidimensional arrays. 
+
  ** The operation-assignment operators +=, -=, *= and /= now behave more
     efficiently in certain cases. For instance, if m is a matrix and s
     a scalar, then the statement
 
       m += s;
  
     will operate on m's data in-place if it is not shared by another variable,
     usually increasing both time and memory efficiency.
