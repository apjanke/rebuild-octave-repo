 If the second argument is exactly 0, then the choice of decomposition is based
 on the matrix @var{A}.  If @var{A} has more rows than columns then an
 economy-sized decomposition is returned, otherwise a regular decomposition
 is calculated.
 
 Algorithm Notes: When calculating the full decomposition (left and right
 singular matrices in addition to singular values) there is a choice of two
