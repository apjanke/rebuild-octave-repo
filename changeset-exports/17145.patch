-A @dfn{variable} is a name that can hold a value.  Although any variable
-can be set by the user, @dfn{built-in variables} typically exist
-specifically so that users can change them to alter the way Octave
-behaves (built-in variables are also sometimes called @dfn{user
-options}).  Ordinary variables and built-in variables are described
-using a format like that for functions except that there are no
-arguments.

-Other variable descriptions have the same format, but `Built-in
-Variable' is replaced by `Variable', for ordinary variables, or
-`Constant' for symbolic constants whose values cannot be changed.
