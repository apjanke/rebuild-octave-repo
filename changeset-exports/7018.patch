 % You only have to set the total width and height of the paper, the
 % horizontal and vertical margin space measured from *paper edge*
 % and the interline and interspec spacing.
 % In order to support a new papersize, you have to fiddle with the
 % latter four dimensions. Just try out a few values.
 % All other values will be computed at process time so it should be
 % quite easy to support different paper sizes - only four values to
 % guess :-)
