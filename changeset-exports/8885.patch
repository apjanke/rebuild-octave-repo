-    The interactive debugging features have been improved.  Stopping
-    on statements with dbstop should work correctly now.  Stepping
-    into and over functions, and stepping one statement at a time
-    (with dbstep) now works.  Moving up and down the call stack with

-    is available to exit the debugging mode.

- ** Improved traceback error messages.
-
-    Traceback error messages are much more concise and easier to
-    understand.  They now display information about the function call
-    stack instead of the stack of all statements that were active at
-    the point of the error.

  ** New experimental OpenGL/FLTK based plotting system.
 
     An experimental plotting system based on OpenGL and the FLTK
     toolkit is now part of Octave.  This backend is disabled by
     default.  You can switch to using it with the command

  ** Object Oriented Programming.
 
     Octave now includes OOP features and the user can create their own

     a directory "@myclass" on the users path.  The class specific

  ** Improved performance for reduction operations.
 
     The performance of the sum, prod, sumsq, cumsum, cumprod, any, all,
     max and min functions has been significantly improved.
 
- ** Diagonal and permutation matrices.

-    The interpreter can now treat diagonal and permutation matrices as

-    general full matrices.  Therefore, it is now possible to construct

-    performance penalty due to storing large numbers of zero elements.

  ** 64-bit integer arithmetic.
 
     Arithmetic with 64-bit integers (int64 and uint64 types) is fully
     supported, with saturation semantics like the other integer types.
     Performance of most integer arithmetic operations has been
     improved by using integer arithmetic directly.  Previously, Octave
     performed integer math with saturation semantics by converting the
     operands to double precision, performing the operation, and then
     converting the result back to an integer value, truncating if
     necessary.

  ** Improvements to the norm function.
 
     The norm function is now able to compute row or column norms of a
     matrix in a single call, as well as general matrix p-norms.
 
- ** New functions for reading and writing images.
-
-    The imwrite and imread functions have been included in Octave.
-    These functions require the GraphicsMagick library.  The new
-    function imfinfo provides information about an image file (size,
-    type, colors, etc.)
-
  ** New functions for computing some eigenvalues or singular values.
 
     The eigs and svds functions have been included in Octave.  These
     functions require the ARPACK library (now distributed under a
     GPL-compatible license).
 
- ** Changes to strcat.
-
-    The strcat function is now compatible with Matlab's strcat
-    function, which removes trailing whitespace when concatenating
-    character strings.  For example

+    greatly improved by caching the help text from all functions that
+    are distributed with Octave.  The pkg function has been modified
+    to generate cache files for external packages when they are
+    installed.
