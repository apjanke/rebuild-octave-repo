     Sparse concatenation is also affected, and concatenating sparse 
     matrices, especially larger collections, is now significantly more 
     efficient. This applies to both the [] operator and the 
     cat/vertcat/horzcat functions.
 
+ ** It is now possible to optionally employ the xGESDD LAPACK drivers for
+    computing the singular value decomposition using svd(), instead of
+    the default xGESVD, using the configuration pseudo-variable 
+    svd_driver. The xGESDD driver can be up to 6x times faster when 
+    singular vectors are requested, but is reported to be somewhat less 
+    robust on highly ill-conditioned matrices.
+
+ ** Configuration pseudo-variables, such as page_screen_output or 
+    confirm_recursive_rmdir (or the above mentioned svd_driver), now 
+    accept a "local" option as second argument, requesting the change 
+    to be undone when current function returns:
+        
+    function [status, msg] = rm_rf (dir)
+      confirm_recursive_rmdir (false, "local");
+      [status, msg] = rmdir (dir, "s");
+      ...
+    endfunction
+    
+    Upon return, confirm_recursive_rmdir will be restored to the value 
+    it had on entry to the function, even if there were subsequent 
+    changes to the variable in function rm_rf or any of the functions
+    it calls.

  ** Compatibility with Matlab graphics has been improved.
 
     The hggroup object and associated listener callback functions have
     been added allowing the inclusion of group objects.  Data sources
     have been added to these group objects such that
