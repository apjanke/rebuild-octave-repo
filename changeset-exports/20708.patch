 ## @item -global
 ## A global installation (package available to all users) is forced, even if
 ## the user doesn't normally have system privileges.
 ##
 ## @item -forge
 ## Install a package directly from the Octave-Forge repository.  This
 ## requires an internet connection and the cURL library.
 ##
+## @emph{Security risk}: no verification of the package is performed
+## before the installation.  There are no signature for packages, or
+## checksums to confirm the correct file was downloaded.  It has the
+## same security issues as manually downloading the package from the
+## Octave Forge repository and installing it.
+##
 ## @item -verbose
 ## The package manager will print the output of all commands as
 ## they are performed.
 ## @end table

 ## @item update
 ## Check installed Octave-Forge packages against repository and update any
