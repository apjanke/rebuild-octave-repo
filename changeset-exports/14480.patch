 @section Build Dependencies
 
 Octave is a fairly large program with many build dependencies.  You may
 be able to find pre-packaged versions of the dependencies distributed as
 part of your system, or you may have to build some or all of them
 yourself.

-The names of pre-compiled packages vary by system and do not always

+On some systems you can obtain many of Octave's build dependencies
+automatically. The commands for doing this vary by system. Similarly,
+the names of pre-compiled packages vary by system and do not always
+match exactly the names listed in @ref{Build Tools} and @ref{External
+Packages}.
 
 You will usually need the development version of an external dependency
 so that you get the libraries and header files for building software,
 not just for running already compiled programs.  These packages
 typically have names that end with the suffix @code{-dev} or @code{-devel}.
 
 On systems with @code{apt-get} (Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), you may be able
 to install most of the tools and external packages using a command
