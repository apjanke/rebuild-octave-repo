doc: small fixes to size() and plot.txi (bug #54283).

* plot.txi: Correct typo "The" -> "They"

* data.cc (Fsize): Correct misuse of "then" to "than".

 Contour group objects are created by the @code{contour}, @code{contourf}, and
-@code{contour3} functions.  The are also one of the handles returned by the
+@code{contour3} functions.  They are also one of the handles returned by the
 @code{surfc} and @code{meshc} functions.  The properties of the contour group
 are
 
 @table @code
 @item contourmatrix
 A read only property that contains the data return by @code{contourc} used to
 create the contours of the plot.

 When given a second argument, @var{dim}, return the size of the corresponding
 dimension.
 
 With a single output argument, @code{size} returns a row vector.  When called
 with multiple output arguments, @code{size} returns the size of dimension N
 in the Nth argument.  The number of rows, dimension 1, is returned in the
 first argument, the number of columns, dimension 2, is returned in the
-second argument, etc.  If there are more dimensions in @var{a} then there are
+second argument, etc.  If there are more dimensions in @var{a} than there are
 output arguments, @code{size} returns the total number of elements in the
 remaining dimensions in the final output argument.
