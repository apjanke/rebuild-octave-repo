 The user can force the type of the matrix with the @code{matrix_type}
 function. This overcomes the cost of discovering the type of the matrix.
 However, it should be noted incorrectly identifying the type of the matrix
 will lead to unpredictable results, and so @code{matrix_type} should be
 used with care.
