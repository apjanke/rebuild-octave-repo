  ** Many of Octave's binary operators (.*, .^, +, -, ...) now perform
     automatic broadcasting for array operations that allows you to use
     operator notation instead of calling bsxfun or expanding arrays (and
     unnecessarily wasting memory) with repmat or similar idioms.  For
     example, to scale the columns of a matrix by the elements of a row
     vector, you may now write

  ** Overhaul of statistical distribution functions

     Functions have been made Matlab-compatible with regard to special
     cases (probability on boundaries, probabilities for values outside
     distribution, etc.).  This may cause subtle changes to existing
     scripts.
 
-    negative binomial function has been extended to real, non-integer inputs.

  ** The effect of comparison operators (<, >, <=, and >=) applied to
     complex numbers has changed to be consistent with the strict
     ordering defined by the `max', `min', and `sort' functions.  More
     specifically, complex numbers are compared by lexicographical
     comparison of the pairs `[abs(z), arg(z)]'.  Previously, only real

  ** The automatic simplification of complex computation results has
     changed.  Octave will now simplify any complex number with a zero
     imaginary part or any complex matrix with all elements having zero
     imaginary part to a real value.  Previously, this was done only for
     positive zeros.  Note that the behavior of the complex function is
     unchanged and it still produces a complex value even if the
