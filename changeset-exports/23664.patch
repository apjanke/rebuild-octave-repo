 ## Save and restore CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS globally.  These variables
 ## are for users, so we shouldn't be touching them.  Instead, we should
 ## set the corresponding AM_ flags (currently by way of the XTRA_ variables).
 ## However, for the duration of the configure script, we may set CFLAGS
 ## and CXXFLAGS so that subsequent tests succeed.  Temporary settings
 ## like this are currently done for pthreads and openmp, for example.
