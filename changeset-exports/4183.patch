+* 11/15/2002: Power MachTen is no longer supported by Tenon Intersystems
+*   since Mac OS X permits running Octave directly on its BSD-based OS.
+*   See http://fink.sourceforge.net for directions on installation of Octave
+*   on Macintosh.
+
 I've installed and run Octave 2.0.12 on Power MachTen 4.1.  I've
 also installed Octave-2.1.14 on Power MachTen 4.1.1 (the process is slightly 
 different).  This note contains instructions on how to port octave to MachTen
 4.1/4.1.1.
 
 Many thanks to Tenon Intersystems support for their help in porting to
 Machten 4.1.1.
