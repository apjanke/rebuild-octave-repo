      between structs with equal keys but different dimensions or values, making
      operations that preserve the fields faster. Economized storage is now used
      for scalar structs (just like most other scalars), making their usage more
      memory-efficient. Certain array-like operations on structs (concatenation,
      uniform cellfun, num2cell) have gained a significant speed-up.
      Additionally, the octave_scalar_map class now provides a simpler interface
      to work with scalar structs within a C++ DLD function.
