  ** The fsolve function now accepts an option structure argument (see
     also the optimset function).
     The INFO values returned from fsolve have changed to be compatible
     with Matlab's fsolve function.
     Additionally, fsolve is now able to solve overdetermined systems.
 
+ ** The norm function is now able to compute row or column norms of a matrix
+    in a single call, as well as general matrix p-norms.
+
  ** Object Oriented Programming
 
     Octave now includes OOP features and the user can create their 
     own class objects and overloaded functions and operators. For
     example, all methods of a class called "myclass" will be found in 
     a directory "@myclass" on the users path. The class specific versions
     of functions and operators take precedence over the generic versions
     of these functions. See the Octave manual for more details.
