 Octave uses the GNU readline library to handle reading and editing
 input.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to the
 cursor movement commands used by GNU Emacs, and a vi-style line
 editing interface is also available.  At the end of each session, the
 command history is saved, so that commands entered during previous
 sessions are not lost.

 This can be used from within oct-files (or in fact any file) with

 for a @code{%!} as the first characters on a new-line to identify test
