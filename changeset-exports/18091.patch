+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 4.2:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
-  ** One of the biggest new features for Octave 3.8 is a graphical user
-     interface.  It is the one thing that users have requested most
-     often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But
-     because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have
-     decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the
-     GUI the default interface (until then, you can use the --force-gui
-     option to start the GUI).
-
-     Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and
-     improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided
-     against delaying the release of all these new improvements any
-     longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of
-     Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working
-     reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough
-     spots and many things that could be improved.
-
-     WE NEED YOUR HELP.  There are many ways that you can help us fix
-     the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall
-     user experience for both novices and experts alike:
-
-       * If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by
-         contributing your time to help with Octave's development.  See
-         http://octave.org/get-involved.html for more information.
-
-       * If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged
-         report the problems you find.  See http://octave.org/bugs.html
-         for more information about how to report problems.
-
-       * Whether you are a user or developer, you can help to fund the
-         project.  Octave development takes a lot of time and expertise.
-         Your contributions help to ensure that Octave will continue to
-         improve.  See http://octave.org/donate.html for more details.
-
-    We hope you find Octave to be useful.  Please help us make it even
-    better for the future!
-
- ** Octave now uses OpenGL graphics by default with FLTK widgets.  If
-    OpenGL libraries or FLTK widgets are not available when Octave is
-    built, gnuplot is used.  You may also choose to use gnuplot for
-    graphics by executing the command
-
-      graphics_toolkit ("gnuplot")
-
-    Adding this command to your ~/.octaverc file will set the default
-    for each session.
-
- ** Printing or saving figures with OpenGL graphics requires the
-    gl2ps library which is no longer distributed with Octave.  The
-    software is widely available in most package managers.  If a
-    pre-compiled package does not exist for your system, you can find
-    the current sources at http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/.
-
- ** Octave now supports nested functions with scoping rules that are
-    compatible with Matlab.  A nested function is one declared and defined
-    within the body of another function.  The nested function is only
-    accessible from within the enclosing function which makes it one
-    method for making private functions whose names do not conflict with those
-    in the global namespace (See also subfunctions and private functions).
-    In addition, variables in the enclosing function are visible within the
-    nested function.  This makes it possible to have a pseudo-global variable
-    which can be seen by a group of functions, but which is not visible in
-    the global namespace.
-    
-    Example:
-    function outerfunc (...)
-      ...
-      function nested1 (...)
-        ...
-        function nested2 (...)
-           ...
-        endfunction
-      endfunction
-
-      function nested3 (...)
-        ...
-      endfunction
-    endfunction
-
- ** Line continuations inside character strings have changed.
-
-    The sequence '...' is no longer recognized as a line continuation
-    inside a character string.  A backslash '\' followed by a newline
-    character is no longer recognized as a line continuation inside
-    single-quoted character strings.  Inside double-quoted character
-    strings, a backslash followed by a newline character is still
-    recognized as a line continuation, but the backslash character must
-    be followed *immediately* by the newline character.  No whitespace or
-    end-of-line comment may appear between them.
-
- ** Backslash as a continuation marker outside of double-quoted strings
-    is now deprecated.
-
-    Using '\' as a continuation marker outside of double quoted strings
-    is now deprecated and will be removed from a future version of
-    Octave.  When that is done, the behavior of
-
-      (a \
-       b)
-
-    will be consistent with other binary operators.
-
- ** Redundant terminal comma accepted by parser
-
-    A redundant terminal comma is now accepted in matrix
-    definitions which allows writing code such as 
-
-    [a,...
-     b,...
-     c,...
-    ] = deal (1,2,3)
-
- ** Octave now has limited support for named exceptions
-
-    The following syntax is now accepted:
-
-      try
-        statements
-      catch exception-id
-        statements
-      end
-
-    The exception-id is a structure with the fields "message" and
-    "identifier".  For example
-
-      try
-        error ("Octave:error-id", "error message");
-      catch myerr
-        printf ("identifier: %s\n", myerr.identifier);
-        printf ("message:    %s\n", myerr.message);
-      end_try_catch
-
-    When classdef-style classes are added to Octave, the exception-id
-    will become an MException object.
-
- ** Warning states may now be set temporarily, until the end of the
-    current function, using the syntax
-
-      warning STATE ID "local"
-
-    in which STATE may be "on", "off", or "error".  Changes to warning
-    states that are set locally affect the current function and all
-    functions called from the current scope.  The previous warning state
-    is restored on return from the current function.  The "local"
-    option is ignored if used in the top-level workspace.
-
- ** Warning IDs renamed:
-
-    Octave:array-as-scalar => Octave:array-to-scalar
-    Octave:array-as-vector => Octave:array-to-vector
-
- ** 'emptymatch', 'noemptymatch' options added to regular expressions.
-
-    With this addition Octave now accepts the entire set of Matlab options
-    for regular expressions.  'noemptymatch' is the default, but 'emptymatch'
-    has certain uses where you need to match an assertion rather than actual
-    characters.  For example, 
-
-    regexprep ('World', '^', 'Hello ', 'emptymatch')
-      => Hello World
-
-    where the pattern is actually the assertion '^' or start-of-line.
-
- ** For compatibility with Matlab, the regexp, regexpi, and regexprep
-    functions now process backslash escape sequences in single-quoted pattern
-    strings.  In addition, the regexprep function now processes backslash
-    escapes in single-quoted replacement strings.  For example,
-    
-    regexprep (str, '\t', '\n')
-
-    would search the variable str for a TAB character (escape sequence \t)
-    and replace it with a NEWLINE (escape sequence \n).  Previously the
-    expression would have searched for a literal '\' followed by 't' and
-    replaced the two characters with the sequence '\', 'n'.
+ ** Other new functions added in 4.2:
 
- ** A TeX parser has been implemented for the FLTK toolkit and is the default
-    for any text object including titles and axis labels.  The TeX parser is
-    supported only for display on a monitor, not for printing.

-    \char        symbol      \beta               Greek symbol beta
-    \fontname    font        \fontname{Arial}    set Arial font

-                             e^{i*\pi} = -1      group objects
-
- ** The m-files in the plot directory have been overhauled.
-
-    The plot functions now produce output that is nearly visually compatible
-    with Matlab.  Plot performance has also increased, dramatically for some
-    functions such as comet and waitbar.  Finally, the documentation for most
-    functions has been updated so it should be clearer both how to use a
-    function and when a function is appropriate.
-
- ** The m-files in the image directory have been overhauled.
-
-    The principal benefit is that Octave will now no longer automatically
-    convert images stored with integers to doubles.  Storing images as uint8
-    or uint16 requires only 1/8 or 1/4 the memory of an image stored using
-    doubles.  For certain operations, such as fft2, the image must still be
-    converted to double in order to work.
-
-    Other changes include fixes to the way indexed images are read from a
-    colormap depending on the image class (integer images have a -1 offset to
-    the colormap row number).
-
- ** The imread and imwrite functions have been completely rewritten.
-
-    The main changes relate to the alpha channel, support for reading and
-    writing of floating point images, implemented writing of indexed images,
-    and appending images to multipage image files.
-
-    The issues that may arise due to backwards incompatibility are:
-
-      * imwrite no longer interprets a length of 2 or 4 in the third dimension
-        as grayscale or RGB with alpha channel (a length of 4 will be saved
-        as a CMYK image).  Alpha channel must be passed as separate argument.
-
-      * imread will always return the colormap indexes when reading an indexed
-        image, even if the colormap is not requested as output.
-
-      * transparency values are now inverted from previous Octave versions
-        (0 is for completely transparent instead of completely opaque).
-
-    In addition, the function imformats has been implemented to expand
-    reading and writing of images of different formats through imread
-    and imwrite.
-
- ** The colormap function now provides new options--"list", "register",
-    and "unregister"--to list all available colormap functions, and to
-    add or remove a function name from the list of known colormap
-    functions.  Packages that implement extra colormaps should use these
-    commands with PKG_ADD and PKG_DEL statements.
-
- ** strsplit has been modified to be compatible with Matlab.  There
-    are two instances where backward compatibility is broken.
-
-    (1) Delimiters are now string vectors, not scalars.
-
-    Octave's legacy behavior
-
-      strsplit ("1 2, 3", ", ")
-      ans = 
-      {
-       [1,1] = 1
-       [1,2] = 2
-       [1,3] = 
-       [1,4] = 3
-      }
-
-    Matlab compatible behavior
-
-      strsplit ("1 2, 3", ", ")
-      ans = 
-      {
-       [1,1] = 1 2
-       [1,2] = 3
-      }
-
-    (2) By default, Matlab treats consecutive delimiters as a single
-    delimiter.  By default, Octave's legacy behavior was to return an
-    empty string for the part between the delmiters.
-
-    Where legacy behavior is desired, the call to strsplit() may be
-    replaced by ostrsplit(), which is Octave's original implementation of
-    strsplit().
-
- ** The datevec function has been extended for better Matlab compatibility.
-    It now accepts string inputs in the following numerical formats: 12, 21,
-    22, 26, 29, 31.  This is undocumented, but verifiable, Matlab behavior.
-    In addition, the default for formats which do not specify a date is
-    January 1st of the current year.  The previous default was the current day,
-    month, and year.  This may produce changes in existing scripts.
-
- ** The error function and its derivatives has been extended to accept complex
-    arguments.  The following functions now accept complex inputs:
-
-    erf  erfc  erfcx   
-
-    In addition two new error functions erfi (imaginary error function) and
-    dawson (scaled imaginary error function) have been added.
-
- ** The glpk function has been modified to reflect changes in the GLPK
-    library.  The "round" and "itcnt" options have been removed.  The
-    "relax" option has been replaced by the "rtest" option.  The numeric
-    values of error codes and of some options have also changed.
-
- ** The kurtosis function has changed definition to be compatible with 
-    Matlab.  It now returns the base kurtosis instead of the "excess kurtosis".
-    The old behavior can be had by changing scripts to normalize with -3.
-
-               "excess kurtosis" = kurtosis (x) - 3
-
- ** The moment function has changed definition to be compatible with 
-    Matlab.  It now returns the central moment instead of the raw moment.
-    The old behavior can be had by passing the type argument "r" for raw.
-
- ** The default name of the Octave crash dump file is now 
-    "octave-workspace" instead of "octave-core".  The exact name can
-    always be customized with the octave_core_file_name function.
-
- ** A citation command has been added to display information on how to
-    cite Octave and packages in publications.  The package system will
-    look for and install CITATION files from packages.
-
- ** The java package from Octave Forge is now part of core Octave.  The
-    following new functions are available for interacting with Java
-    directly from Octave:
-
-      debug_java     java_matrix_autoconversion
-      isjava         java_unsigned_autoconversion
-      java2mat       javaaddpath
-      javaArray      javaclasspath
-      javaMethod     javamem
-      javaObject     javarmpath
-                     usejava
-
-    In addition, the following functions that use the Java interface
-    are now available (provided that Octave is compiled with support for
-    Java enabled):
-
-      helpdlg    listdlg   questdlg
-      inputdlg   msgbox    warndlg
-
- ** Other new functions added in 3.8.0:
-
-      atan2d                     erfi             lines
-      base64_decode              expint           linsolve
-      base64_encode              findfigs         missing_component_hook
-      betaincinv                 flintmax         polyeig
-      built_in_docstrings_file   fminsearch       prefdir
-      cmpermute                  gallery          preferences
-      cmunique                   gco              readline_re_read_init_file
-      colorcube                  hdl2struct       readline_read_init_file
-      copyobj                    history_save     rgbplot
-      dawson                     imformats        save_default_options
-      dblist                     importdata       shrinkfaces
-      desktop                    isaxes           splinefit
-      doc_cache_create           iscolormap       stemleaf
-      ellipj                     isequaln         strjoin
-      ellipke                    jit_debug        struct2hdl
-      erfcinv                    jit_enable       tetramesh
-                                 jit_startcnt     waterfall
+      dir_in_loadpath

-Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.6:
+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 4.0:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
- ** The PCRE library is now required to build Octave.  If a pre-compiled
-    package does not exist for your system, you can find PCRE sources
-    at http://www.pcre.org
-
- ** The ARPACK library is no longer distributed with Octave.
-    If you need the eigs or svds functions you must provide an
-    external ARPACK through a package manager or by compiling it
-    yourself.  If a pre-compiled package does not exist for your system,
-    you can find the current ARPACK sources at
-    http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng
-
- ** Many of Octave's binary operators (.*, .^, +, -, ...) now perform
-    automatic broadcasting for array operations which allows you to use
-    operator notation instead of calling bsxfun or expanding arrays (and
-    unnecessarily wasting memory) with repmat or similar idioms.  For
-    example, to scale the columns of a matrix by the elements of a row
-    vector, you may now write
-
-      rv .* M
-
-    In this expression, the number of elements of rv must match the
-    number of columns of M.  The following operators are affected:
-
-      plus      +  .+
-      minus     -  .-
-      times     .*
-      rdivide   ./
-      ldivide   .\
-      power     .^  .**
-      lt        <
-      le        <=
-      eq        ==
-      gt        >
-      ge        >=
-      ne        !=  ~=
-      and       &
-      or        |
-      atan2
-      hypot
-      max
-      min
-      mod
-      rem
-      xor
-
-    additionally, since the A op= B assignment operators are equivalent
-    to A = A op B, the following operators are also affected:
-
-      +=  -=  .+=  .-=  .*=  ./=  .\=  .^=  .**=  &=  |=
-
-    See the "Broadcasting" section in the new "Vectorization and Faster
-    Code Execution" chapter of the manual for more details.
-
- ** Octave now features a profiler, thanks to the work of Daniel Kraft
-    under the Google Summer of Code mentorship program.  The manual has
-    been updated to reflect this addition.  The new user-visible
-    functions are profile, profshow, and profexplore.
-
- ** Overhaul of statistical distribution functions
-
-    Functions now return "single" outputs for inputs of class "single".
-
-    75% reduction in memory usage through use of logical indexing.
-
-    Random sample functions now use the same syntax as rand and accept
-    a comma separated list of dimensions or a dimension vector.
-
-    Functions have been made Matlab-compatible with regard to special
-    cases (probability on boundaries, probabilities for values outside
-    distribution, etc.).  This may cause subtle changes to existing
-    scripts.
-
-    negative binomial function has been extended to real, non-integer
-    inputs.  The discrete_inv function now returns v(1) for 0 instead of
-    NaN.  The nbincdf function has been recoded to use a closed form
-    solution with betainc.
-
- ** strread, textscan, and textread have been completely revamped.
-
-    They now support nearly all Matlab functionality including:
-
-      * Matlab-compatible whitespace and delimiter defaults
-
-      * Matlab-compatible options: 'whitespace', treatasempty', format
-        string repeat count, user-specified comment style, uneven-length
-        output arrays, %n and %u conversion specifiers (provisionally)
+ ** Other new functions added in 4.0.0:
 
- ** All .m string functions have been modified for better performance or
-    greater Matlab compatibility.  Performance gains of 15X-30X have
-    been demonstrated.  Operations on cell array of strings no longer pay
-    quite as high a penalty as those on 2-D character arrays.
-
-      deblank:  Now requires character or cellstr input.
-
-      strtrim:  Now requires character or cellstr input.
-                No longer trims nulls ("\0") from string for Matlab
-                compatibility.
-
-      strmatch: Follows documentation precisely and ignores trailing spaces
-                in pattern and in string.  Note that this is documented
-                Matlab behavior but the implementation apparently does
-                not always follow it.
-
-      substr:   Now possible to specify a negative LEN option which
-                extracts to within LEN of the end of the string.
-
-      strtok:   Now accepts cellstr input.
-
-      base2dec, bin2dec, hex2dec:
-                Now accept cellstr inputs.
-
-      dec2base, dec2bin, dec2hex:
-                Now accept cellstr inputs.
-
-      index, rindex:
-                Now accept 2-D character array input.
-
-      strsplit: Now accepts 2-D character array input.
-
- ** Geometry functions derived from Qhull (convhull, delaunay, voronoi)
-    have been revamped.  The options passed to the underlying qhull
-    command have been changed for better results or for Matlab
-    compatibility.
-
-      convhull: Default options are "Qt" for 2D, 3D, 4D inputs
-                Default options are "Qt Qx" for 5D and higher
-
-      delaunay: Default options are "Qt Qbb Qc Qz" for 2D and 3D inputs
-                Default options are "Qt Qbb Qc Qx" for 4D and higher
-
-      voronoi:  No default arguments
-
- ** Date/Time functions updated.  Millisecond support with FFF format
-    string now supported.
-
-    datestr: Numerical formats 21, 22, 29 changed to match Matlab.
-             Now accepts cellstr input.
-
- ** The following warning IDs have been removed:
-
-      Octave:associativity-change
-      Octave:complex-cmp-ops
-      Octave:empty-list-elements
-      Octave:fortran-indexing
-      Octave:precedence-change
-      
- ** The warning ID Octave:string-concat has been renamed to
-    Octave:mixed-string-concat.
-
- ** Octave now includes the following Matlab-compatible preference
-    functions:
-
-      addpref  getpref  ispref  rmpref  setpref
-
- ** The following Matlab-compatible handle graphics functions have been
-    added:
-
-      guidata         uipanel        uitoolbar
-      guihandles      uipushtool     uiwait
-      uicontextmenu   uiresume       waitfor
-      uicontrol       uitoggletool
-
-    The uiXXX functions above are experimental.
-
-    Except for uiwait and uiresume, the uiXXX functions are not
-    supported with the FLTK+OpenGL graphics toolkit.
-
-    The gnuplot graphics toolkit does not support any of the uiXXX
-    functions nor the waitfor function.
-
- ** New keyword parfor (parallel for loop) is now recognized as a valid
-    keyword.  Implementation, however, is still mapped to an ordinary
-    for loop.
-
- ** Other new functions added in 3.6.0:
-
-      bicg                       nthargout                   usejava
-      is_dq_string               narginchk                   waitbar
-      is_sq_string               python                      zscore
-      is_function_handle         register_graphics_toolkit 
-      loaded_graphics_toolkits   recycle                   
+      validateattributes
 
  ** Deprecated functions.

+      error_text         
 
- ** IMPORTANT note about binary incompatibility in this release:
-
-    Binary compatibility for all 3.4.x releases was originally planned,
-    but this is impossible for the 3.4.1 release due to a bug in the way
-    shared libraries were built in Octave 3.4.0.  Because of this bug,
-    .oct files built for Octave 3.4.0 must be recompiled before they
-    will work with Octave 3.4.1.
-
-    Given that there would be binary incompatibilities with shared
-    libraries going from Octave 3.4.0 to 3.4.1, the following
-    incompatible changes were also made in this release:
-
-      * The Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library is now
-        required to build Octave.
-
-      * Octave's libraries and .oct files are now installed in
-        subdirectories of $libdir instead of $libexecdir.
-
-    Any future Octave 3.4.x release versions should remain binary
-    compatible with Octave 3.4.1 as proper library versioning is now
-    being used as recommended by the libtool manual.
+    The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 4.0 and will
+    be removed from Octave 4.4 (or whatever version is the second major
+    release after 4.0):
 
- ** The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 3.4.1 and will
-    be removed from Octave 3.8 (or whatever version is the second major
-    release after 3.4):
-
-      cquad  is_duplicate_entry  perror  strerror
-
- ** The following functions are new in 3.4.1:
-
-      colstyle  gmres  iscolumn  isrow  mgorth  nproc  rectangle
-
- ** The get_forge_pkg function is now private.
+    *none*
 
- ** The rectangle_lw, rectangle_sw, triangle_lw, and triangle_sw
-    functions are now private.
-
- ** The logistic_regression_derivatives and logistic_regression_likelihood
-    functions are now private.
-
- ** ChangeLog files in the Octave sources are no longer maintained
-    by hand.  Instead, there is a single ChangeLog file generated from
-    the Mercurial version control commit messages.  Older ChangeLog
-    information can be found in the etc/OLD-ChangeLogs directory in the
-    source distribution.
-
-Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.4:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
- ** BLAS and LAPACK libraries are now required to build Octave.  The
-    subset of the reference BLAS and LAPACK libraries has been removed
-    from the Octave sources.
-  
- ** The ARPACK library is now distributed with Octave so it no longer
-    needs to be available as an external dependency when building
-    Octave.
-
- ** The `lookup' function was extended to be more useful for
-    general-purpose binary searching.  Using this improvement, the
-    ismember function was rewritten for significantly better
-    performance.
-
- ** Real, integer and logical matrices, when used in indexing, will now
-    cache the internal index_vector value (zero-based indices) when
-    successfully used as indices, eliminating the conversion penalty for
-    subsequent indexing by the same matrix.  In particular, this means it
-    is no longer needed to avoid repeated indexing by logical arrays
-    using find for performance reasons.
-
- ** Logical matrices are now treated more efficiently when used as
-    indices.  Octave will keep the index as a logical mask unless the
-    ratio of true elements is small enough, using a specialized
-    code.  Previously, all logical matrices were always first converted
-    to index vectors.  This results in savings in both memory and
-    computing time.
-
- ** The `sub2ind' and `ind2sub' functions were reimplemented as compiled
-    functions for better performance.  These functions are now faster,
-    can deliver more economized results for ranges, and can reuse the
-    index cache mechanism described in previous paragraph.
-
- ** The built-in function equivalents to associative operators (`plus',
-    `times', `mtimes', `and', and `or') have been extended to accept
-    multiple arguments.  This is especially useful for summing
-    (multiplying, etc.) lists of objects (of possibly distinct types):
-   
-      matrix_sum = plus (matrix_list{:});
-
- ** An FTP object type based on libcurl has been implemented.  These
-    objects allow ftp connections, downloads and uploads to be
-    managed.  For example,
-
-      fp = ftp ("ftp.octave.org);
-      cd (fp, "gnu/octave");
-      mget (fp, "octave-3.2.3.tar.bz2");
-      close (fp);
-
- ** The default behavior of `assert (observed, expected)' has been
-    relaxed to employ less strict checking that does not require the
-    internals of the values to match.  This avoids previously valid
-    tests from breaking due to new internal classes introduced in future
-    Octave versions.
-
-    For instance, all of these assertions were true in Octave 3.0.x
-    but false in 3.2.x due to new optimizations and improvements:
-
-      assert (2*linspace (1, 5, 5), 2*(1:5))
-      assert (zeros (0, 0), [])
-      assert (2*ones (1, 5), (2) (ones (1,5)))
-
- ** The behavior of library functions `ismatrix', `issquare', and
-    `issymmetric' has been changed for better consistency.
-    
-    * The `ismatrix' function now returns true for all numeric,
-      logical and character 2-D or N-D matrices.  Previously, `ismatrix' 
-      returned false if the first or second dimension was zero.
-      Hence, `ismatrix ([])' was false, 
-      while `ismatrix (zeros (1,2,0))' was true.
-
-    * The `issquare' function now returns a logical scalar, and is
-      equivalent to the expression
-
-        ismatrix (x) && ndims (x) == 2 && rows (x) == columns (x)
-
-      The dimension is no longer returned.  As a result, `issquare ([])'
-      now yields true.
-    
-    * The `issymmetric' function now checks for symmetry instead of
-      Hermitianness.  For the latter, ishermitian was created.  Also,
-      logical scalar is returned rather than the dimension, so
-      `issymmetric ([])' is now true.
-      
- ** Function handles are now aware of overloaded functions.  If a
-    function is overloaded, the handle determines at the time of its
-    reference which function to call.  A non-overloaded version does not
-    need to exist.
-
- ** Overloading functions for built-in classes (double, int8, cell,
-    etc.) is now compatible with Matlab.
-
- ** Function handles can now be compared with the == and != operators,
-    as well as the `isequal' function.
-
- ** Performance of concatenation (using []) and the functions `cat',
-    `horzcat', and `vertcat' has been improved for multidimensional
-    arrays.
-
- ** The operation-assignment operators +=, -=, *= and /= now behave more
-    efficiently in certain cases.  For instance, if M is a matrix and S a
-    scalar, then the statement
-
-      M += S;
- 
-    will operate on M's data in-place if it is not shared by another
-    variable, usually increasing both time and memory efficiency.
-    
-    Only selected common combinations are affected, namely:
-    
-      matrix += matrix
-      matrix -= matrix
-      matrix .*= matrix
-      matrix ./= matrix
-
-      matrix += scalar
-      matrix -= scalar
-      matrix *= scalar
-      matrix /= scalar
-
-      logical matrix |= logical matrix
-      logical matrix &= logical matrix
-
-    where matrix and scalar belong to the same class.  The left-hand
-    side must be a simple variable reference.
-
-    Moreover, when unary operators occur in expressions, Octave will
-    also try to do the operation in-place if it's argument is a
-    temporary expression.
-
- ** The effect of comparison operators (<, >, <=, and >=) applied to
-    complex numbers has changed to be consistent with the strict
-    ordering defined by the `max', `min', and `sort' functions.  More
-    specifically, complex numbers are compared by lexicographical
-    comparison of the pairs `[abs(z), arg(z)]'.  Previously, only real
-    parts were compared; this can be trivially achieved by converting
-    the operands to real values with the `real' function.
-
- ** The automatic simplification of complex computation results has
-    changed.  Octave will now simplify any complex number with a zero
-    imaginary part or any complex matrix with all elements having zero
-    imaginary part to a real value.  Previously, this was done only for
-    positive zeros.  Note that the behavior of the complex function is
-    unchanged and it still produces a complex value even if the
-    imaginary part is zero.
-
- ** As a side effect of code refactoring in liboctave, the binary
-    logical operations are now more easily amenable to compiler
-    optimizations and are thus significantly faster.
-
- ** Octave now allows user-defined `subsasgn' methods to optimize out
-    redundant copies.  For more information, see the manual.
-
- ** More efficient matrix division handling.  Octave is now able to
-    handle the expressions
-    
-      M' \ V
-      M.' \ V
-      V / M 
-
-    (M is a matrix and V is a vector) more efficiently in certain cases.
-    In particular, if M is triangular, all three expressions will be
-    handled by a single call to xTRTRS (from LAPACK), with appropriate
-    flags.  Previously, all three expressions required a physical
-    transpose of M.
-
- ** More efficient handling of certain mixed real-complex matrix
-    operations.  For instance, if RM is a real matrix and CM a complex
-    matrix,
-    
-      RM * CM
-
-    can now be evaluated either as
-
-      complex (RM * real (CM), RM * imag (CM))
-
-    or as
-
-      complex (RM) * CM,
-
-    depending on the dimensions.  The first form requires more
-    temporaries and copying, but halves the FLOP count, which normally
-    brings better performance if RM has enough rows.  Previously, the
-    second form was always used.
-
-    Matrix division is similarly affected.
-
- ** More efficient handling of triangular matrix factors returned from
-    factorizations.  The functions for computing QR, LU and Cholesky
-    factorizations will now automatically return the triangular matrix
-    factors with proper internal matrix_type set, so that it won't need
-    to be computed when the matrix is used for division.
-
- ** The built-in `sum' function now handles the non-native summation
-    (i.e., double precision sum of single or integer inputs) more
-    efficiently, avoiding a temporary conversion of the whole input
-    array to doubles.  Further, `sum' can now accept an extra option
-    argument, using a compensated summation algorithm rather than a
-    straightforward sum, which significantly improves precision if lots
-    of cancellation occurs in the summation.
-
- ** The built-in `bsxfun' function now uses optimized code for certain
-    cases where built-in operator handles are passed in.  Namely, the
-    optimizations concern the operators `plus', `minus', `times',
-    `ldivide', `rdivide', `power', `and', `or' (for logical arrays),
-    the relational operators `eq', `ne', `lt', `le', `gt', `ge', and the
-    functions `min' and `max'.  Optimizations only apply when both
-    operands are of the same built-in class.  Mixed real/complex and
-    single/double operations will first convert both operands to a
-    common type.
-
- ** The `strfind' and `strrep' functions now have compiled
-    implementations, facilitating significantly more efficient searching
-    and replacing in strings, especially with longer patterns.  The code
-    of `strcat' has been vectorized and is now much more efficient when
-    many strings are concatenated.  The `strcmpi' and `strncmpi'
-    functions are now built-in functions, providing better performance.
-
- ** 'str2double' now has a compiled implementation and the API conforms
-    to Matlab.  The additional Octave-specific features of returning a
-    boolean matrix indicating which elements were successfully converted
-    has been removed.
- 
- ** Matlab-style ignoring input and output function arguments using
-    tilde (~) is now supported.  Ignored output arguments may be
-    detected from a function using the built-in function `isargout'.
-    For more details, consult the manual. 
-
- ** The list datatype, deprecated since the introduction of cells, has
-    been removed.
-
- ** The accumarray function has been optimized and is now significantly
-    faster in certain important cases.
-
- ** The behavior of isreal and isnumeric functions was changed to be more
-    Matlab-compatible.
-
- ** The integer math & conversion warnings (Octave:int-convert-nan,
-    Octave:int-convert-non-int-val, Octave:int-convert-overflow,
-    Octave:int-math-overflow) have been removed.
-
- ** rem and mod are now built-in functions.  They also handle integer
-    types efficiently using integer arithmetic.
-
- ** Sparse indexing and indexed assignment has been mostly rewritten.
-    Since Octave uses compressed column storage for sparse matrices,
-    major attention is devoted to operations manipulating whole columns.
-    Such operations are now significantly faster, as well as some other
-    important cases.
-
-    Further, it is now possible to pre-allocate a sparse matrix and
-    subsequently fill it by assignments, provided they meet certain
-    conditions.  For more information, consult the `spalloc' function,
-    which is no longer a mere dummy.  Consequently, nzmax and nnz are no
-    longer always equal in Octave.  Octave may also produce a matrix
-    with nnz < nzmax as a result of other operations, so you should
-    consistently use nnz unless you really want to use nzmax (i.e., the
-    space allocated for nonzero elements).
-
-    Sparse concatenation is also affected, and concatenating sparse 
-    matrices, especially larger collections, is now significantly more 
-    efficient.  This applies to both the [] operator and the 
-    cat/vertcat/horzcat functions.
-
- ** It is now possible to optionally employ the xGESDD LAPACK drivers
-    for computing the singular value decomposition using svd, instead
-    of the default xGESVD, using the configuration pseudo-variable
-    svd_driver.  The xGESDD driver can be up to 6x times faster when
-    singular vectors are requested, but is reported to be somewhat less
-    robust on highly ill-conditioned matrices.
-
- ** Configuration pseudo-variables, such as page_screen_output or 
-    confirm_recursive_rmdir (or the above mentioned svd_driver), now 
-    accept a "local" option as second argument, requesting the change 
-    to be undone when the current function returns:
-        
-    function [status, msg] = rm_rf (dir)
-      confirm_recursive_rmdir (false, "local");
-      [status, msg] = rmdir (dir, "s");
-      ...
-    endfunction
-    
-    Upon return, confirm_recursive_rmdir will be restored to the value 
-    it had on entry to the function, even if there were subsequent 
-    changes to the variable in function rm_rf or any of the functions
-    it calls.
-
- ** pkg now accepts a -forge option for downloading and installing
-    packages from Octave Forge automatically.  For example, 
-    
-      pkg install -forge general
-    
-    will automatically download the latest release of the general
-    package and attempt to install it.  No automatic resolving of
-    dependencies is provided.  Further,
-
-      pkg list -forge
-    
-    can be used to list all available packages.
-
- ** The internal data representation of structs has been completely
-    rewritten to make certain optimizations feasible.  The field data
-    can now be shared between structs with equal keys but different
-    dimensions or values, making operations that preserve the fields
-    faster.  Economized storage is now used for scalar structs (just
-    like most other scalars), making their usage more
-    memory-efficient.  Certain array-like operations on structs
-    (concatenation, uniform cellfun, num2cell) have gained a
-    significant speed-up.  Additionally, the octave_scalar_map class
-    now provides a simpler interface to work with scalar structs within
-    a C++ DLD function.
-
- ** Two new formats are available for displaying numbers:
-
-      format short eng
-      format long eng
-
-    Both display numbers in engineering notation, i.e., mantissa +
-    exponent where the exponent is a multiple of 3.
-
- ** The following functions are new in Octave 3.4:
-      accumdim    erfcx        nfields      pqpnonneg  uigetdir

-
- ** Using the image function to view images with external programs such
-    as display, xv, and xloadimage is no longer supported.  The
-    image_viewer function has also been removed.
-
- ** The behavior of struct assignments to non-struct values has been
-    changed.  Previously, it was possible to overwrite an arbitrary
-    value:
-
-      a = 1;
-      a.x = 2;
-
-    This is no longer possible unless a is an empty matrix or cell
-    array.
- 
- ** The dlmread function has been extended to allow specifying a custom
-    value for empty fields.
-
- ** The dlmread and dlmwrite functions have been modified to accept
-    file IDs (as returned by fopen) in addition to file names.
-
- ** Octave can now optimize away the interpreter overhead of an
-    anonymous function handle, if the function simply calls another
-    function or handle with some of its parameters bound to certain
-    values.  Example:
-    
-      f = @(x) sum (x, 1);
-
-    When f is called, the call is forwarded to @sum with the constant 1
-    appended, and the anonymous function call does not occur on the
-    call stack.
-
- ** For compatibility with Matlab, mu2lin (x) is now equivalent to
-    mu2lin (x, 0).
-
- ** The new function `history_control' may be used to control the way
-    command lines are added to the history list when Octave is using
-    readline for command-line editing.  For example
-
-      history_control ("ignoredups")
-
-    tells Octave to avoid adding duplicate lines to the history list.
-
- ** Octave now uses the gnulib library for improved portability and to
-    avoid bugs in operating system functions.
-
- ** Deprecated functions.
-
-    The following functions were deprecated in Octave 3.0 and have been
-    removed from Octave 3.4.

-
-Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.2:
----------------------------------------------------------
-
- ** Compatibility with Matlab graphics has been improved.
-
-    The hggroup object and associated listener callback functions have
-    been added allowing the inclusion of group objects.  Data sources
-    have been added to these group objects such that
-
-           x = 0:0.1:10;
-           y = sin (x);
-           plot (x, y, "ydatasource", "y");
-           for i = 1 : 100
-             pause(0.1)
-             y = sin (x + 0.1 * i);
-             refreshdata ();
-           endfor
-
-    works as expected.  This capability has be used to introduce
-    stem-series, bar-series, etc., objects for better Matlab
-    compatibility.
-
- ** New graphics functions:
-
-      addlistener                  ezcontour   gcbo         refresh  
-      addproperty                  ezcontourf  ginput       refreshdata
-      allchild                     ezmesh      gtext        specular
-      available_graphics_toolkits  ezmeshc     intwarning   surfl
-      graphics_toolkit             ezplot      ishghandle   trisurf
-      cla                          ezplot3     isocolors    waitforbuttonpress
-      clabel                       ezpolar     isonormals
-      comet                        ezsurf      isosurface  
-      dellistener                  findall     linkprop   
-      diffuse                      gcbf        plotmatrix
-
- ** New experimental OpenGL/FLTK based plotting system.
-
-    An experimental plotting system based on OpenGL and the FLTK
-    toolkit is now part of Octave.  This graphics toolkit is disabled by
-    default.  You can switch to using it with the command
-
-        graphics_toolkit ("fltk")
-
-    for all future figures or for a particular figure with the command
-
-        graphics_toolkit (h, "fltk")
-
-    where "h" is a valid figure handle.
-
- ** Functions providing direct access to gnuplot have been removed.
-
-    The functions __gnuplot_plot__, __gnuplot_set__, __gnuplot_raw__,
-     __gnuplot_show__, __gnuplot_replot__, __gnuplot_splot__,
-     __gnuplot_save_data__ and __gnuplot_send_inline_data__ have been
-     removed from Octave.  These function were incompatible with the
-     high level graphics handle code.
-
- ** The Control, Finance and Quaternion functions have been removed.
-
-    These functions are now available as separate packages from
-
-      http://octave.sourceforge.net/packages.html
-
-    and can be reinstalled using the Octave package manager (see
-    the pkg function).
-
- ** Specific sparse matrix functions removed.
-
-    The following functions, which handled only sparse matrices have
-    been removed.  Instead of calling these functions directly, you
-    should use the corresponding function without the "sp" prefix.
-
-      spatan2     spcumsum  spkron   spprod
-      spchol      spdet     splchol  spqr
-      spchol2inv  spdiag    splu     spsum
-      spcholinv   spfind    spmax    spsumsqk
-      spcumprod   spinv     spmin
-
- ** Improvements to the debugger.
-
-    The interactive debugging features have been improved.  Stopping
-    on statements with dbstop should work correctly now.  Stepping
-    into and over functions, and stepping one statement at a time
-    (with dbstep) now works.  Moving up and down the call stack with
-    dbup and dbdown now works.  The dbstack function is now available
-    to print the current function call stack.  The new dbquit function
-    is available to exit the debugging mode.
-
- ** Improved traceback error messages.
-
-    Traceback error messages are much more concise and easier to
-    understand.  They now display information about the function call
-    stack instead of the stack of all statements that were active at
-    the point of the error.
-
- ** Object Oriented Programming.
-
-    Octave now includes OOP features and the user can create their own
-    class objects and overloaded functions and operators.  For
-    example, all methods of a class called "myclass" will be found in
-    a directory "@myclass" on the users path.  The class specific
-    versions of functions and operators take precedence over the
-    generic versions of these functions.
-
-    New functions related to OOP include
-
-      class  inferiorto  isobject  loadobj  methods  superiorto
-
-    See the Octave manual for more details.
-
- ** Parsing of Command-style Functions.
-
-    Octave now parses command-style functions without needing to first
-    declare them with "mark_as_command".  The rules for recognizing a
-    command-style function calls are
-
-      * A command must appear as the first word in a statement,
-        followed by a space.
-
-      * The first character after the space must not be '=' or '('
-
-      * The next token after the space must not look like a binary
-        operator.
-
-    These rules should be mostly compatible with the way Matlab parses
-    command-style function calls and allow users to define commands in
-    .m files without having to mark them as commands.
-
-    Note that previous versions of Octave allowed expressions like
-
-      x = load -text foo.dat
-
-    but an expression like this will now generate a parse error.  In
-    order to assign the value returned by a function to a variable,
-    you must use the normal function call syntax:
-
-      x = load ("-text", "foo.dat");
-
- ** Block comments.
-
-    Commented code can be between matching "#{" and "#}" or "%{" and
-    "%}" markers, even if the commented code spans several line.  This
-    allows blocks code to be commented, without needing to comment
-    each line.  For example,
-
-    function [s, t] = func (x, y)
-      s = 2 * x;
-    #{
-      s *= y;
-      t = y + x;
-    #}
-    endfunction
-
-    the lines "s *= y;" and "t = y + x" will not be executed.
-
- ** If any subfunction in a file ends with "end" or "endfunction", then
-    they all must end that way.  Previously, Octave accepted
-
-      function main ()
-        ...
-      # no endfunction here.
-      function sub ()
-        ...
-      endfunction
-
-    but this is no longer allowed.
-
- ** Special treatment in the parser of expressions like "a' * b".
-
-    In these cases the transpose is no longer explicitly formed and
-    BLAS libraries are called with the transpose flagged,
-    significantly improving performance for these kinds of
-    operations.
-
- ** Single Precision data type.
-
-    Octave now includes a single precision data type.  Single
-    precision variables can be created with the "single" command, or
-    from functions like ones, eye, etc.  For example,
-
-      single (1)
-      ones (2, 2, "single")
-      zeros (2, 2, "single")
-      eye (2, 2, "single")
-      Inf (2, 2, "single")
-      NaN (2, 2, "single")
-      NA (2, 2, "single")
-
-    all create single precision variables.  For compatibility with
-    Matlab, mixed double/single precision operators and functions
-    return single precision types.
-
-    As a consequence of this addition to Octave the internal
-    representation of the double precision NA value has changed, and
-    so users that make use of data generated by Octave with R or
-    visa-versa are warned that compatibility might not be assured.
-
- ** Improved array indexing.
-
-    The underlying code used for indexing of arrays has been
-    completely rewritten and indexing is now significantly faster.
-
- ** Improved memory management.
-
-    Octave will now attempt to share data in some cases where previously
-    a copy would be made, such as certain array slicing operations or
-    conversions between cells, structs and cs-lists.  This usually reduces
-    both time and memory consumption.
-    Also, Octave will now attempt to detect and optimize usage of a vector 
-    as a stack, when elements are being repeatedly inserted at/removed from 
-    the end of the vector.
-
- ** Improved performance for reduction operations.
-
-    The performance of the sum, prod, sumsq, cumsum, cumprod, any, all,
-    max and min functions has been significantly improved.
-
- ** Sorting and searching.
-    
-    The performance of sort has been improved, especially when sorting
-    indices are requested.  An efficient built-in issorted
-    implementation was added.  The sortrows function now uses a more
-    efficient algorithm, especially in the homogeneous case.  The lookup
-    function is now a built-in function performing a binary search,
-    optimized for long runs of close elements.  Lookup also works with
-    cell arrays of strings.
-
- ** Range arithmetics
-
-    For some operations on ranges, Octave will attempt to keep the
-    result as a range.  These include negation, adding a scalar,
-    subtracting a scalar, and multiplying by a scalar.  Ranges with zero
-    increment are allowed and can be constructed using the built-in
-    function `ones'.
-
- ** Various performance improvements.
-
-    Performance of a number of other built-in operations and functions
-    was improved, including:
-
-    * logical operations
-    * comparison operators
-    * element-wise power
-    * accumarray
-    * cellfun
-    * isnan
-    * isinf
-    * isfinite
-    * nchoosek
-    * repmat
-    * strcmp
-
- ** 64-bit integer arithmetic.
-
-    Arithmetic with 64-bit integers (int64 and uint64 types) is fully
-    supported, with saturation semantics like the other integer types.
-    Performance of most integer arithmetic operations has been
-    improved by using integer arithmetic directly.  Previously, Octave
-    performed integer math with saturation semantics by converting the
-    operands to double precision, performing the operation, and then
-    converting the result back to an integer value, truncating if
-    necessary.
-
- ** Diagonal and permutation matrices.
-
-    The interpreter can now treat diagonal and permutation matrices as
-    special objects that store only the non-zero elements, rather than
-    general full matrices.  Therefore, it is now possible to construct
-    and use these matrices in linear algebra without suffering a
-    performance penalty due to storing large numbers of zero elements.
-
- ** Improvements to fsolve.
-
-    The fsolve function now accepts an option structure argument (see
-    also the optimset function).  The INFO values returned from fsolve
-    have changed to be compatible with Matlab's fsolve function.
-    Additionally, fsolve is now able to solve overdetermined systems,
-    complex-differentiable complex systems, systems with a sparse
-    jacobian and can work in single precision if given single precision
-    inputs.  It can also be called recursively.
-
- ** Improvements to the norm function.
-
-    The norm function is now able to compute row or column norms of a
-    matrix in a single call, as well as general matrix p-norms.
-
- ** New functions for computing some eigenvalues or singular values.
-
-    The eigs and svds functions have been included in Octave.  These
-    functions require the ARPACK library (now distributed under a
-    GPL-compatible license).
-
- ** New QR and Cholesky factorization updating functions.
-
-      choldelete  cholshift   qrdelete  qrshift
-      cholinsert  cholupdate  qrinsert  qrupdate
-
- ** New quadrature functions.
-
-      dblquad  quadgk  quadv  triplequad
-
- ** New functions for reading and writing images.
-
-    The imwrite and imread functions have been included in Octave.
-    These functions require the GraphicsMagick library.  The new
-    function imfinfo provides information about an image file (size,
-    type, colors, etc.)
-
- ** The input_event_hook function has been replaced by the pair of
-    functions add_input_event_hook and remove_input_event_hook so that
-    more than one hook function may be installed at a time.
-
- ** Other miscellaneous new functions.
-
-      addtodate          hypot                       reallog
-      bicgstab           idivide                     realpow
-      cellslices         info                        realsqrt
-      cgs                interp1q                    rectint
-      command_line_path  isdebugmode                 regexptranslate
-      contrast           isfloat                     restoredefaultpath
-      convn              isstrprop                   roundb
-      cummin             log1p                       rundemos
-      cummax             lsqnonneg                   runlength
-      datetick           matlabroot                  saveobj
-      display            namelengthmax               spaugment
-      expm1              nargoutchk                  strchr
-      filemarker         pathdef                     strvcat
-      fstat              perl                        subspace
-      full               prctile                     symvar
-      fzero              quantile                    treelayout
-      genvarname         re_read_readline_init_file  validatestring
-      histc
-
- ** Changes to strcat.
-
-    The strcat function is now compatible with Matlab's strcat
-    function, which removes trailing whitespace when concatenating
-    character strings.  For example
-
-      strcat ('foo ', 'bar')
-      ==> 'foobar'
-
-    The new function cstrcat provides the previous behavior of
-    Octave's strcat.
-
- ** Improvements to the help functions.
-
-    The help system has been mostly re-implemented in .m files to make
-    it easier to modify.  Performance of the lookfor function has been
-    greatly improved by caching the help text from all functions that
-    are distributed with Octave.  The pkg function has been modified
-    to generate cache files for external packages when they are
-    installed.
-
- ** Deprecated functions.
-
-    The following functions were deprecated in Octave 3.0 and will be
-    removed from Octave 3.4 (or whatever version is the second major
-    release after 3.0):
-                                           
-      beta_cdf         geometric_pdf       pascal_pdf      
-      beta_inv         geometric_rnd       pascal_rnd      
-      beta_pdf         hypergeometric_cdf  poisson_cdf     
-      beta_rnd         hypergeometric_inv  poisson_inv     
-      binomial_cdf     hypergeometric_pdf  poisson_pdf

+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.8:
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+  ** One of the biggest new features for Octave 3.8 is a graphical user
+     interface.  It is the one thing that users have requested most
+     often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But
+     because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have
+     decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the
+     GUI the default interface (until then, you can use the --force-gui
+     option to start the GUI).
+
+     Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and
+     improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided
+     against delaying the release of all these new improvements any
+     longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of
+     Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working
+     reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough
+     spots and many things that could be improved.
+
+     WE NEED YOUR HELP.  There are many ways that you can help us fix
+     the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall
+     user experience for both novices and experts alike:
+
+       * If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by
+         contributing your time to help with Octave's development.  See
+         http://octave.org/get-involved.html for more information.
+
+       * If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged
+         report the problems you find.  See http://octave.org/bugs.html
+         for more information about how to report problems.
+
+       * Whether you are a user or developer, you can help to fund the
+         project.  Octave development takes a lot of time and expertise.
+         Your contributions help to ensure that Octave will continue to
+         improve.  See http://octave.org/donate.html for more details.
+
+    We hope you find Octave to be useful.  Please help us make it even
+    better for the future!
+
+ ** Octave now uses OpenGL graphics by default with FLTK widgets.  If
+    OpenGL libraries or FLTK widgets are not available when Octave is
+    built, gnuplot is used.  You may also choose to use gnuplot for
+    graphics by executing the command
+
+      graphics_toolkit ("gnuplot")
+
+    Adding this command to your ~/.octaverc file will set the default
+    for each session.
+
+ ** Printing or saving figures with OpenGL graphics requires the
+    gl2ps library which is no longer distributed with Octave.  The
+    software is widely available in most package managers.  If a
+    pre-compiled package does not exist for your system, you can find
+    the current sources at http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/.
+
+ ** Octave now supports nested functions with scoping rules that are
+    compatible with Matlab.  A nested function is one declared and defined
+    within the body of another function.  The nested function is only
+    accessible from within the enclosing function which makes it one
+    method for making private functions whose names do not conflict with those
+    in the global namespace (See also subfunctions and private functions).
+    In addition, variables in the enclosing function are visible within the
+    nested function.  This makes it possible to have a pseudo-global variable
+    which can be seen by a group of functions, but which is not visible in
+    the global namespace.
+    
+    Example:
+    function outerfunc (...)
+      ...
+      function nested1 (...)
+        ...
+        function nested2 (...)
+           ...
+        endfunction
+      endfunction
+
+      function nested3 (...)
+        ...
+      endfunction
+    endfunction
+
+ ** Line continuations inside character strings have changed.
+
+    The sequence '...' is no longer recognized as a line continuation
+    inside a character string.  A backslash '\' followed by a newline
+    character is no longer recognized as a line continuation inside
+    single-quoted character strings.  Inside double-quoted character
+    strings, a backslash followed by a newline character is still
+    recognized as a line continuation, but the backslash character must
+    be followed *immediately* by the newline character.  No whitespace or
+    end-of-line comment may appear between them.
+
+ ** Backslash as a continuation marker outside of double-quoted strings
+    is now deprecated.
+
+    Using '\' as a continuation marker outside of double quoted strings
+    is now deprecated and will be removed from a future version of
+    Octave.  When that is done, the behavior of
+
+      (a \
+       b)
+
+    will be consistent with other binary operators.
+
+ ** Redundant terminal comma accepted by parser
+
+    A redundant terminal comma is now accepted in matrix
+    definitions which allows writing code such as 
+
+    [a,...
+     b,...
+     c,...
+    ] = deal (1,2,3)
+
+ ** Octave now has limited support for named exceptions
+
+    The following syntax is now accepted:
+
+      try
+        statements
+      catch exception-id
+        statements
+      end
+
+    The exception-id is a structure with the fields "message" and
+    "identifier".  For example
+
+      try
+        error ("Octave:error-id", "error message");
+      catch myerr
+        printf ("identifier: %s\n", myerr.identifier);
+        printf ("message:    %s\n", myerr.message);
+      end_try_catch
+
+    When classdef-style classes are added to Octave, the exception-id
+    will become an MException object.
+
+ ** Warning states may now be set temporarily, until the end of the
+    current function, using the syntax
+
+      warning STATE ID "local"
+
+    in which STATE may be "on", "off", or "error".  Changes to warning
+    states that are set locally affect the current function and all
+    functions called from the current scope.  The previous warning state
+    is restored on return from the current function.  The "local"
+    option is ignored if used in the top-level workspace.
+
+ ** Warning IDs renamed:
+
+    Octave:array-as-scalar => Octave:array-to-scalar
+    Octave:array-as-vector => Octave:array-to-vector
+
+ ** 'emptymatch', 'noemptymatch' options added to regular expressions.
+
+    With this addition Octave now accepts the entire set of Matlab options
+    for regular expressions.  'noemptymatch' is the default, but 'emptymatch'
+    has certain uses where you need to match an assertion rather than actual
+    characters.  For example, 
+
+    regexprep ('World', '^', 'Hello ', 'emptymatch')
+      => Hello World
+
+    where the pattern is actually the assertion '^' or start-of-line.
+
+ ** For compatibility with Matlab, the regexp, regexpi, and regexprep
+    functions now process backslash escape sequences in single-quoted pattern
+    strings.  In addition, the regexprep function now processes backslash
+    escapes in single-quoted replacement strings.  For example,
+    
+    regexprep (str, '\t', '\n')
+
+    would search the variable str for a TAB character (escape sequence \t)
+    and replace it with a NEWLINE (escape sequence \n).  Previously the
+    expression would have searched for a literal '\' followed by 't' and
+    replaced the two characters with the sequence '\', 'n'.
+
+ ** A TeX parser has been implemented for the FLTK toolkit and is the default
+    for any text object including titles and axis labels.  The TeX parser is
+    supported only for display on a monitor, not for printing.

+                             e^{i*\pi} = -1      group objects
+
+ ** The m-files in the plot directory have been overhauled.
+
+    The plot functions now produce output that is nearly visually compatible
+    with Matlab.  Plot performance has also increased, dramatically for some
+    functions such as comet and waitbar.  Finally, the documentation for most
+    functions has been updated so it should be clearer both how to use a
+    function and when a function is appropriate.
+
+ ** The m-files in the image directory have been overhauled.
+
+    The principal benefit is that Octave will now no longer automatically
+    convert images stored with integers to doubles.  Storing images as uint8
+    or uint16 requires only 1/8 or 1/4 the memory of an image stored using
+    doubles.  For certain operations, such as fft2, the image must still be
+    converted to double in order to work.
+
+    Other changes include fixes to the way indexed images are read from a
+    colormap depending on the image class (integer images have a -1 offset to
+    the colormap row number).
+
+ ** The imread and imwrite functions have been completely rewritten.
+
+    The main changes relate to the alpha channel, support for reading and
+    writing of floating point images, implemented writing of indexed images,
+    and appending images to multipage image files.
+
+    The issues that may arise due to backwards incompatibility are:
+
+      * imwrite no longer interprets a length of 2 or 4 in the third dimension
+        as grayscale or RGB with alpha channel (a length of 4 will be saved
+        as a CMYK image).  Alpha channel must be passed as separate argument.
+
+      * imread will always return the colormap indexes when reading an indexed
+        image, even if the colormap is not requested as output.
+
+      * transparency values are now inverted from previous Octave versions
+        (0 is for completely transparent instead of completely opaque).
+
+    In addition, the function imformats has been implemented to expand
+    reading and writing of images of different formats through imread
+    and imwrite.
+
+ ** The colormap function now provides new options--"list", "register",
+    and "unregister"--to list all available colormap functions, and to
+    add or remove a function name from the list of known colormap
+    functions.  Packages that implement extra colormaps should use these
+    commands with PKG_ADD and PKG_DEL statements.
+
+ ** strsplit has been modified to be compatible with Matlab.  There
+    are two instances where backward compatibility is broken.
+
+    (1) Delimiters are now string vectors, not scalars.
+
+    Octave's legacy behavior
+
+      strsplit ("1 2, 3", ", ")
+      ans = 
+      {
+       [1,1] = 1
+       [1,2] = 2
+       [1,3] = 
+       [1,4] = 3
+      }
+
+    Matlab compatible behavior
+
+      strsplit ("1 2, 3", ", ")
+      ans = 
+      {
+       [1,1] = 1 2
+       [1,2] = 3
+      }
+
+    (2) By default, Matlab treats consecutive delimiters as a single
+    delimiter.  By default, Octave's legacy behavior was to return an
+    empty string for the part between the delmiters.
+
+    Where legacy behavior is desired, the call to strsplit() may be
+    replaced by ostrsplit(), which is Octave's original implementation of
+    strsplit().
+
+ ** The datevec function has been extended for better Matlab compatibility.
+    It now accepts string inputs in the following numerical formats: 12, 21,
+    22, 26, 29, 31.  This is undocumented, but verifiable, Matlab behavior.
+    In addition, the default for formats which do not specify a date is
+    January 1st of the current year.  The previous default was the current day,
+    month, and year.  This may produce changes in existing scripts.
+
+ ** The error function and its derivatives has been extended to accept complex
+    arguments.  The following functions now accept complex inputs:
+
+    erf  erfc  erfcx   
+
+    In addition two new error functions erfi (imaginary error function) and
+    dawson (scaled imaginary error function) have been added.
+
+ ** The glpk function has been modified to reflect changes in the GLPK
+    library.  The "round" and "itcnt" options have been removed.  The
+    "relax" option has been replaced by the "rtest" option.  The numeric
+    values of error codes and of some options have also changed.
+
+ ** The kurtosis function has changed definition to be compatible with 
+    Matlab.  It now returns the base kurtosis instead of the "excess kurtosis".
+    The old behavior can be had by changing scripts to normalize with -3.
+
+               "excess kurtosis" = kurtosis (x) - 3
+
+ ** The moment function has changed definition to be compatible with 
+    Matlab.  It now returns the central moment instead of the raw moment.
+    The old behavior can be had by passing the type argument "r" for raw.
+
+ ** The default name of the Octave crash dump file is now 
+    "octave-workspace" instead of "octave-core".  The exact name can
+    always be customized with the octave_core_file_name function.
+
+ ** A citation command has been added to display information on how to
+    cite Octave and packages in publications.  The package system will
+    look for and install CITATION files from packages.
+
+ ** The java package from Octave Forge is now part of core Octave.  The
+    following new functions are available for interacting with Java
+    directly from Octave:
+
+      debug_java     java_matrix_autoconversion
+      isjava         java_unsigned_autoconversion
+      java2mat       javaaddpath
+      javaArray      javaclasspath
+      javaMethod     javamem
+      javaObject     javarmpath
+                     usejava
+
+    In addition, the following functions that use the Java interface
+    are now available (provided that Octave is compiled with support for
+    Java enabled):
+
+      helpdlg    listdlg   questdlg
+      inputdlg   msgbox    warndlg
+
+ ** Other new functions added in 3.8.0:
+
+      atan2d                     erfi             lines
+      base64_decode              expint           linsolve
+      base64_encode              findfigs         missing_component_hook
+      betaincinv                 flintmax         polyeig
+      built_in_docstrings_file   fminsearch       prefdir
+      cmpermute                  gallery          preferences
+      cmunique                   gco              readline_re_read_init_file
+      colorcube                  hdl2struct       readline_read_init_file
+      copyobj                    history_save     rgbplot
+      dawson                     imformats        save_default_options
+      dblist                     importdata       shrinkfaces
+      desktop                    isaxes           splinefit
+      doc_cache_create           iscolormap       stemleaf
+      ellipj                     isequaln         strjoin
+      ellipke                    jit_debug        struct2hdl
+      erfcinv                    jit_enable       tetramesh
+                                 jit_startcnt     waterfall
+
+ ** Deprecated functions.
+
+    The following functions were deprecated in Octave 3.4 and have been
+    removed from Octave 3.8.

+
+
+    The following keywords have been deprecated in Octave 3.8 and will
+    be removed from Octave 3.12 (or whatever version is the second major
+    release after 3.8):
+
+      static

+
+    The internal class <Octave_map> has been deprecated in Octave 3.8 and will
+    be removed from Octave 3.12 (or whatever version is the second major

+    or <octave_scalar_map> for a single structure.
+
+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.6:
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+ ** The PCRE library is now required to build Octave.  If a pre-compiled
+    package does not exist for your system, you can find PCRE sources
+    at http://www.pcre.org
+
+ ** The ARPACK library is no longer distributed with Octave.
+    If you need the eigs or svds functions you must provide an
+    external ARPACK through a package manager or by compiling it
+    yourself.  If a pre-compiled package does not exist for your system,
+    you can find the current ARPACK sources at
+    http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng
+
+ ** Many of Octave's binary operators (.*, .^, +, -, ...) now perform
+    automatic broadcasting for array operations which allows you to use
+    operator notation instead of calling bsxfun or expanding arrays (and
+    unnecessarily wasting memory) with repmat or similar idioms.  For
+    example, to scale the columns of a matrix by the elements of a row
+    vector, you may now write
+
+      rv .* M
+
+    In this expression, the number of elements of rv must match the
+    number of columns of M.  The following operators are affected:
+
+      plus      +  .+
+      minus     -  .-
+      times     .*
+      rdivide   ./
+      ldivide   .\
+      power     .^  .**
+      lt        <
+      le        <=
+      eq        ==
+      gt        >
+      ge        >=
+      ne        !=  ~=
+      and       &
+      or        |
+      atan2
+      hypot
+      max
+      min
+      mod
+      rem
+      xor
+
+    additionally, since the A op= B assignment operators are equivalent
+    to A = A op B, the following operators are also affected:
+
+      +=  -=  .+=  .-=  .*=  ./=  .\=  .^=  .**=  &=  |=
+
+    See the "Broadcasting" section in the new "Vectorization and Faster
+    Code Execution" chapter of the manual for more details.
+
+ ** Octave now features a profiler, thanks to the work of Daniel Kraft
+    under the Google Summer of Code mentorship program.  The manual has
+    been updated to reflect this addition.  The new user-visible
+    functions are profile, profshow, and profexplore.
+
+ ** Overhaul of statistical distribution functions
+
+    Functions now return "single" outputs for inputs of class "single".
+
+    75% reduction in memory usage through use of logical indexing.
+
+    Random sample functions now use the same syntax as rand and accept
+    a comma separated list of dimensions or a dimension vector.
+
+    Functions have been made Matlab-compatible with regard to special
+    cases (probability on boundaries, probabilities for values outside
+    distribution, etc.).  This may cause subtle changes to existing
+    scripts.
+
+    negative binomial function has been extended to real, non-integer
+    inputs.  The discrete_inv function now returns v(1) for 0 instead of
+    NaN.  The nbincdf function has been recoded to use a closed form
+    solution with betainc.
+
+ ** strread, textscan, and textread have been completely revamped.
+
+    They now support nearly all Matlab functionality including:
+
+      * Matlab-compatible whitespace and delimiter defaults
+
+      * Matlab-compatible options: 'whitespace', treatasempty', format
+        string repeat count, user-specified comment style, uneven-length
+        output arrays, %n and %u conversion specifiers (provisionally)
+
+ ** All .m string functions have been modified for better performance or
+    greater Matlab compatibility.  Performance gains of 15X-30X have
+    been demonstrated.  Operations on cell array of strings no longer pay
+    quite as high a penalty as those on 2-D character arrays.
+
+      deblank:  Now requires character or cellstr input.
+
+      strtrim:  Now requires character or cellstr input.
+                No longer trims nulls ("\0") from string for Matlab
+                compatibility.
+
+      strmatch: Follows documentation precisely and ignores trailing spaces
+                in pattern and in string.  Note that this is documented
+                Matlab behavior but the implementation apparently does
+                not always follow it.
+
+      substr:   Now possible to specify a negative LEN option which
+                extracts to within LEN of the end of the string.
+
+      strtok:   Now accepts cellstr input.
+
+      base2dec, bin2dec, hex2dec:
+                Now accept cellstr inputs.
+
+      dec2base, dec2bin, dec2hex:
+                Now accept cellstr inputs.
+
+      index, rindex:
+                Now accept 2-D character array input.
+
+      strsplit: Now accepts 2-D character array input.
+
+ ** Geometry functions derived from Qhull (convhull, delaunay, voronoi)
+    have been revamped.  The options passed to the underlying qhull
+    command have been changed for better results or for Matlab
+    compatibility.
+
+      convhull: Default options are "Qt" for 2D, 3D, 4D inputs
+                Default options are "Qt Qx" for 5D and higher
+
+      delaunay: Default options are "Qt Qbb Qc Qz" for 2D and 3D inputs
+                Default options are "Qt Qbb Qc Qx" for 4D and higher
+
+      voronoi:  No default arguments
+
+ ** Date/Time functions updated.  Millisecond support with FFF format
+    string now supported.
+
+    datestr: Numerical formats 21, 22, 29 changed to match Matlab.
+             Now accepts cellstr input.
+
+ ** The following warning IDs have been removed:
+
+      Octave:associativity-change
+      Octave:complex-cmp-ops
+      Octave:empty-list-elements
+      Octave:fortran-indexing
+      Octave:precedence-change
+      
+ ** The warning ID Octave:string-concat has been renamed to
+    Octave:mixed-string-concat.
+
+ ** Octave now includes the following Matlab-compatible preference
+    functions:
+
+      addpref  getpref  ispref  rmpref  setpref
+
+ ** The following Matlab-compatible handle graphics functions have been
+    added:
+
+      guidata         uipanel        uitoolbar
+      guihandles      uipushtool     uiwait
+      uicontextmenu   uiresume       waitfor
+      uicontrol       uitoggletool
+
+    The uiXXX functions above are experimental.
+
+    Except for uiwait and uiresume, the uiXXX functions are not
+    supported with the FLTK+OpenGL graphics toolkit.
+
+    The gnuplot graphics toolkit does not support any of the uiXXX
+    functions nor the waitfor function.
+
+ ** New keyword parfor (parallel for loop) is now recognized as a valid
+    keyword.  Implementation, however, is still mapped to an ordinary
+    for loop.
+
+ ** Other new functions added in 3.6.0:
+
+      bicg                       nthargout                   usejava
+      is_dq_string               narginchk                   waitbar
+      is_sq_string               python                      zscore
+      is_function_handle         register_graphics_toolkit 
+      loaded_graphics_toolkits   recycle                   
+
+ ** Deprecated functions.
+
+    The following functions were deprecated in Octave 3.2 and have been
+    removed from Octave 3.6.
+                                           
+      create_set          spcholinv    splu   
+      dmult               spcumprod    spmax
+      iscommand           spcumsum     spmin

+      mark_as_command     sphcat       spsumsq
+      mark_as_rawcommand  spinv        spvcat 
+      spatan2             spkron       str2mat
+      spchol              splchol      unmark_command
+      spchol2inv          split        unmark_rawcommand
+
+    The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 3.6 and will
+    be removed from Octave 3.10 (or whatever version is the second major
+    release after 3.6):
+
+      cut                polyderiv
+      cor                shell_cmd 
+      corrcoef           studentize
+      __error_text__     sylvester_matrix
+      error_text         
+
+ ** The following functions have been modified for Matlab compatibility:
+
+      randperm
+
+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.4.3:
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+ ** Octave 3.4.3 is a bug fixing release.
+     
+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.4.2:
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+ ** Octave 3.4.2 fixes some minor installation problems that affected
+    version 3.4.1.
+
+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.4.1:
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+ ** Octave 3.4.1 is primarily a bug fixing release.
+
+ ** IMPORTANT note about binary incompatibility in this release:
+
+    Binary compatibility for all 3.4.x releases was originally planned,
+    but this is impossible for the 3.4.1 release due to a bug in the way
+    shared libraries were built in Octave 3.4.0.  Because of this bug,
+    .oct files built for Octave 3.4.0 must be recompiled before they
+    will work with Octave 3.4.1.
+
+    Given that there would be binary incompatibilities with shared
+    libraries going from Octave 3.4.0 to 3.4.1, the following
+    incompatible changes were also made in this release:
+
+      * The Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library is now
+        required to build Octave.
+
+      * Octave's libraries and .oct files are now installed in
+        subdirectories of $libdir instead of $libexecdir.
+
+    Any future Octave 3.4.x release versions should remain binary
+    compatible with Octave 3.4.1 as proper library versioning is now
+    being used as recommended by the libtool manual.
+
+ ** The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 3.4.1 and will
+    be removed from Octave 3.8 (or whatever version is the second major
+    release after 3.4):
+
+      cquad  is_duplicate_entry  perror  strerror
+
+ ** The following functions are new in 3.4.1:
+
+      colstyle  gmres  iscolumn  isrow  mgorth  nproc  rectangle
+
+ ** The get_forge_pkg function is now private.
+
+ ** The rectangle_lw, rectangle_sw, triangle_lw, and triangle_sw
+    functions are now private.
+
+ ** The logistic_regression_derivatives and logistic_regression_likelihood
+    functions are now private.
+
+ ** ChangeLog files in the Octave sources are no longer maintained
+    by hand.  Instead, there is a single ChangeLog file generated from
+    the Mercurial version control commit messages.  Older ChangeLog
+    information can be found in the etc/OLD-ChangeLogs directory in the
+    source distribution.
+
+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.4:
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+ ** BLAS and LAPACK libraries are now required to build Octave.  The
+    subset of the reference BLAS and LAPACK libraries has been removed
+    from the Octave sources.
+  
+ ** The ARPACK library is now distributed with Octave so it no longer
+    needs to be available as an external dependency when building
+    Octave.
+
+ ** The `lookup' function was extended to be more useful for
+    general-purpose binary searching.  Using this improvement, the
+    ismember function was rewritten for significantly better
+    performance.
+
+ ** Real, integer and logical matrices, when used in indexing, will now
+    cache the internal index_vector value (zero-based indices) when
+    successfully used as indices, eliminating the conversion penalty for
+    subsequent indexing by the same matrix.  In particular, this means it
+    is no longer needed to avoid repeated indexing by logical arrays
+    using find for performance reasons.
+
+ ** Logical matrices are now treated more efficiently when used as
+    indices.  Octave will keep the index as a logical mask unless the
+    ratio of true elements is small enough, using a specialized
+    code.  Previously, all logical matrices were always first converted
+    to index vectors.  This results in savings in both memory and
+    computing time.
+
+ ** The `sub2ind' and `ind2sub' functions were reimplemented as compiled
+    functions for better performance.  These functions are now faster,
+    can deliver more economized results for ranges, and can reuse the
+    index cache mechanism described in previous paragraph.
+
+ ** The built-in function equivalents to associative operators (`plus',
+    `times', `mtimes', `and', and `or') have been extended to accept
+    multiple arguments.  This is especially useful for summing
+    (multiplying, etc.) lists of objects (of possibly distinct types):
+   
+      matrix_sum = plus (matrix_list{:});
+
+ ** An FTP object type based on libcurl has been implemented.  These
+    objects allow ftp connections, downloads and uploads to be
+    managed.  For example,
+
+      fp = ftp ("ftp.octave.org);
+      cd (fp, "gnu/octave");
+      mget (fp, "octave-3.2.3.tar.bz2");
+      close (fp);
+
+ ** The default behavior of `assert (observed, expected)' has been
+    relaxed to employ less strict checking that does not require the
+    internals of the values to match.  This avoids previously valid
+    tests from breaking due to new internal classes introduced in future
+    Octave versions.
+
+    For instance, all of these assertions were true in Octave 3.0.x
+    but false in 3.2.x due to new optimizations and improvements:
+
+      assert (2*linspace (1, 5, 5), 2*(1:5))
+      assert (zeros (0, 0), [])
+      assert (2*ones (1, 5), (2) (ones (1,5)))
+
+ ** The behavior of library functions `ismatrix', `issquare', and
+    `issymmetric' has been changed for better consistency.
+    
+    * The `ismatrix' function now returns true for all numeric,
+      logical and character 2-D or N-D matrices.  Previously, `ismatrix' 
+      returned false if the first or second dimension was zero.
+      Hence, `ismatrix ([])' was false, 
+      while `ismatrix (zeros (1,2,0))' was true.
+
+    * The `issquare' function now returns a logical scalar, and is
+      equivalent to the expression
+
+        ismatrix (x) && ndims (x) == 2 && rows (x) == columns (x)
+
+      The dimension is no longer returned.  As a result, `issquare ([])'
+      now yields true.
+    
+    * The `issymmetric' function now checks for symmetry instead of
+      Hermitianness.  For the latter, ishermitian was created.  Also,
+      logical scalar is returned rather than the dimension, so
+      `issymmetric ([])' is now true.
+      
+ ** Function handles are now aware of overloaded functions.  If a
+    function is overloaded, the handle determines at the time of its
+    reference which function to call.  A non-overloaded version does not
+    need to exist.
+
+ ** Overloading functions for built-in classes (double, int8, cell,
+    etc.) is now compatible with Matlab.
+
+ ** Function handles can now be compared with the == and != operators,
+    as well as the `isequal' function.
+
+ ** Performance of concatenation (using []) and the functions `cat',
+    `horzcat', and `vertcat' has been improved for multidimensional
+    arrays.
+
+ ** The operation-assignment operators +=, -=, *= and /= now behave more
+    efficiently in certain cases.  For instance, if M is a matrix and S a
+    scalar, then the statement
+
+      M += S;
+ 
+    will operate on M's data in-place if it is not shared by another
+    variable, usually increasing both time and memory efficiency.
+    
+    Only selected common combinations are affected, namely:
+    
+      matrix += matrix
+      matrix -= matrix
+      matrix .*= matrix
+      matrix ./= matrix
+
+      matrix += scalar
+      matrix -= scalar
+      matrix *= scalar
+      matrix /= scalar
+
+      logical matrix |= logical matrix
+      logical matrix &= logical matrix
+
+    where matrix and scalar belong to the same class.  The left-hand
+    side must be a simple variable reference.
+
+    Moreover, when unary operators occur in expressions, Octave will
+    also try to do the operation in-place if it's argument is a
+    temporary expression.
+
+ ** The effect of comparison operators (<, >, <=, and >=) applied to
+    complex numbers has changed to be consistent with the strict
+    ordering defined by the `max', `min', and `sort' functions.  More
+    specifically, complex numbers are compared by lexicographical
+    comparison of the pairs `[abs(z), arg(z)]'.  Previously, only real
+    parts were compared; this can be trivially achieved by converting
+    the operands to real values with the `real' function.
+
+ ** The automatic simplification of complex computation results has
+    changed.  Octave will now simplify any complex number with a zero
+    imaginary part or any complex matrix with all elements having zero
+    imaginary part to a real value.  Previously, this was done only for
+    positive zeros.  Note that the behavior of the complex function is
+    unchanged and it still produces a complex value even if the
+    imaginary part is zero.
+
+ ** As a side effect of code refactoring in liboctave, the binary
+    logical operations are now more easily amenable to compiler
+    optimizations and are thus significantly faster.
+
+ ** Octave now allows user-defined `subsasgn' methods to optimize out
+    redundant copies.  For more information, see the manual.
+
+ ** More efficient matrix division handling.  Octave is now able to
+    handle the expressions
+    
+      M' \ V
+      M.' \ V
+      V / M 
+
+    (M is a matrix and V is a vector) more efficiently in certain cases.
+    In particular, if M is triangular, all three expressions will be
+    handled by a single call to xTRTRS (from LAPACK), with appropriate
+    flags.  Previously, all three expressions required a physical
+    transpose of M.
+
+ ** More efficient handling of certain mixed real-complex matrix
+    operations.  For instance, if RM is a real matrix and CM a complex
+    matrix,
+    
+      RM * CM
+
+    can now be evaluated either as
+
+      complex (RM * real (CM), RM * imag (CM))
+
+    or as
+
+      complex (RM) * CM,
+
+    depending on the dimensions.  The first form requires more
+    temporaries and copying, but halves the FLOP count, which normally
+    brings better performance if RM has enough rows.  Previously, the
+    second form was always used.
+
+    Matrix division is similarly affected.
+
+ ** More efficient handling of triangular matrix factors returned from
+    factorizations.  The functions for computing QR, LU and Cholesky
+    factorizations will now automatically return the triangular matrix
+    factors with proper internal matrix_type set, so that it won't need
+    to be computed when the matrix is used for division.
+
+ ** The built-in `sum' function now handles the non-native summation
+    (i.e., double precision sum of single or integer inputs) more
+    efficiently, avoiding a temporary conversion of the whole input
+    array to doubles.  Further, `sum' can now accept an extra option
+    argument, using a compensated summation algorithm rather than a
+    straightforward sum, which significantly improves precision if lots
+    of cancellation occurs in the summation.
+
+ ** The built-in `bsxfun' function now uses optimized code for certain
+    cases where built-in operator handles are passed in.  Namely, the
+    optimizations concern the operators `plus', `minus', `times',
+    `ldivide', `rdivide', `power', `and', `or' (for logical arrays),
+    the relational operators `eq', `ne', `lt', `le', `gt', `ge', and the
+    functions `min' and `max'.  Optimizations only apply when both
+    operands are of the same built-in class.  Mixed real/complex and
+    single/double operations will first convert both operands to a
+    common type.
+
+ ** The `strfind' and `strrep' functions now have compiled
+    implementations, facilitating significantly more efficient searching
+    and replacing in strings, especially with longer patterns.  The code
+    of `strcat' has been vectorized and is now much more efficient when
+    many strings are concatenated.  The `strcmpi' and `strncmpi'
+    functions are now built-in functions, providing better performance.
+
+ ** 'str2double' now has a compiled implementation and the API conforms
+    to Matlab.  The additional Octave-specific features of returning a
+    boolean matrix indicating which elements were successfully converted
+    has been removed.
+ 
+ ** Matlab-style ignoring input and output function arguments using
+    tilde (~) is now supported.  Ignored output arguments may be
+    detected from a function using the built-in function `isargout'.
+    For more details, consult the manual. 
+
+ ** The list datatype, deprecated since the introduction of cells, has
+    been removed.
+
+ ** The accumarray function has been optimized and is now significantly
+    faster in certain important cases.
+
+ ** The behavior of isreal and isnumeric functions was changed to be more
+    Matlab-compatible.
+
+ ** The integer math & conversion warnings (Octave:int-convert-nan,
+    Octave:int-convert-non-int-val, Octave:int-convert-overflow,
+    Octave:int-math-overflow) have been removed.
+
+ ** rem and mod are now built-in functions.  They also handle integer
+    types efficiently using integer arithmetic.
+
+ ** Sparse indexing and indexed assignment has been mostly rewritten.
+    Since Octave uses compressed column storage for sparse matrices,
+    major attention is devoted to operations manipulating whole columns.
+    Such operations are now significantly faster, as well as some other
+    important cases.
+
+    Further, it is now possible to pre-allocate a sparse matrix and
+    subsequently fill it by assignments, provided they meet certain
+    conditions.  For more information, consult the `spalloc' function,
+    which is no longer a mere dummy.  Consequently, nzmax and nnz are no
+    longer always equal in Octave.  Octave may also produce a matrix
+    with nnz < nzmax as a result of other operations, so you should
+    consistently use nnz unless you really want to use nzmax (i.e., the
+    space allocated for nonzero elements).
+
+    Sparse concatenation is also affected, and concatenating sparse 
+    matrices, especially larger collections, is now significantly more 
+    efficient.  This applies to both the [] operator and the 
+    cat/vertcat/horzcat functions.
+
+ ** It is now possible to optionally employ the xGESDD LAPACK drivers
+    for computing the singular value decomposition using svd, instead
+    of the default xGESVD, using the configuration pseudo-variable
+    svd_driver.  The xGESDD driver can be up to 6x times faster when
+    singular vectors are requested, but is reported to be somewhat less
+    robust on highly ill-conditioned matrices.
+
+ ** Configuration pseudo-variables, such as page_screen_output or 
+    confirm_recursive_rmdir (or the above mentioned svd_driver), now 
+    accept a "local" option as second argument, requesting the change 
+    to be undone when the current function returns:
+        
+    function [status, msg] = rm_rf (dir)
+      confirm_recursive_rmdir (false, "local");
+      [status, msg] = rmdir (dir, "s");
+      ...
+    endfunction
+    
+    Upon return, confirm_recursive_rmdir will be restored to the value 
+    it had on entry to the function, even if there were subsequent 
+    changes to the variable in function rm_rf or any of the functions
+    it calls.
+
+ ** pkg now accepts a -forge option for downloading and installing
+    packages from Octave Forge automatically.  For example, 
+    
+      pkg install -forge general
+    
+    will automatically download the latest release of the general
+    package and attempt to install it.  No automatic resolving of
+    dependencies is provided.  Further,
+
+      pkg list -forge
+    
+    can be used to list all available packages.
+
+ ** The internal data representation of structs has been completely
+    rewritten to make certain optimizations feasible.  The field data
+    can now be shared between structs with equal keys but different
+    dimensions or values, making operations that preserve the fields
+    faster.  Economized storage is now used for scalar structs (just
+    like most other scalars), making their usage more
+    memory-efficient.  Certain array-like operations on structs
+    (concatenation, uniform cellfun, num2cell) have gained a
+    significant speed-up.  Additionally, the octave_scalar_map class
+    now provides a simpler interface to work with scalar structs within
+    a C++ DLD function.
+
+ ** Two new formats are available for displaying numbers:
+
+      format short eng
+      format long eng
+
+    Both display numbers in engineering notation, i.e., mantissa +
+    exponent where the exponent is a multiple of 3.
+
+ ** The following functions are new in Octave 3.4:
+      accumdim    erfcx        nfields      pqpnonneg  uigetdir
+      bitpack     fileread     nth_element  quadcc     uigetfile
+      bitunpack   fminbnd      onCleanup    randi      uiputfile
+      blkmm       fskipl       pbaspect     repelems   uimenu           
+      cbrt        ifelse       pie3         reset      whitebg          
+      curl        ishermitian  powerset     rsf2csf            
+      chop        isindex      ppder        saveas             
+      daspect     luupdate     ppint        strread                     
+      divergence  merge        ppjumps      textread             
+
+ ** Using the image function to view images with external programs such
+    as display, xv, and xloadimage is no longer supported.  The
+    image_viewer function has also been removed.
+
+ ** The behavior of struct assignments to non-struct values has been
+    changed.  Previously, it was possible to overwrite an arbitrary
+    value:
+
+      a = 1;
+      a.x = 2;
+
+    This is no longer possible unless a is an empty matrix or cell
+    array.
+ 
+ ** The dlmread function has been extended to allow specifying a custom
+    value for empty fields.
+
+ ** The dlmread and dlmwrite functions have been modified to accept
+    file IDs (as returned by fopen) in addition to file names.
+
+ ** Octave can now optimize away the interpreter overhead of an
+    anonymous function handle, if the function simply calls another
+    function or handle with some of its parameters bound to certain
+    values.  Example:
+    
+      f = @(x) sum (x, 1);
+
+    When f is called, the call is forwarded to @sum with the constant 1
+    appended, and the anonymous function call does not occur on the
+    call stack.
+
+ ** For compatibility with Matlab, mu2lin (x) is now equivalent to
+    mu2lin (x, 0).
+
+ ** The new function `history_control' may be used to control the way
+    command lines are added to the history list when Octave is using
+    readline for command-line editing.  For example
+
+      history_control ("ignoredups")
+
+    tells Octave to avoid adding duplicate lines to the history list.
+
+ ** Octave now uses the gnulib library for improved portability and to
+    avoid bugs in operating system functions.
+
+ ** Deprecated functions.
+
+    The following functions were deprecated in Octave 3.0 and have been
+    removed from Octave 3.4.

+
+Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.2:
+---------------------------------------------------------
+
+ ** Compatibility with Matlab graphics has been improved.
+
+    The hggroup object and associated listener callback functions have
+    been added allowing the inclusion of group objects.  Data sources
+    have been added to these group objects such that
+
+           x = 0:0.1:10;
+           y = sin (x);
+           plot (x, y, "ydatasource", "y");
+           for i = 1 : 100
+             pause(0.1)
+             y = sin (x + 0.1 * i);
+             refreshdata ();
+           endfor
+
+    works as expected.  This capability has be used to introduce
+    stem-series, bar-series, etc., objects for better Matlab
+    compatibility.
+
+ ** New graphics functions:
+
+      addlistener                  ezcontour   gcbo         refresh  
+      addproperty                  ezcontourf  ginput       refreshdata
+      allchild                     ezmesh      gtext        specular
+      available_graphics_toolkits  ezmeshc     intwarning   surfl
+      graphics_toolkit             ezplot      ishghandle   trisurf
+      cla                          ezplot3     isocolors    waitforbuttonpress
+      clabel                       ezpolar     isonormals
+      comet                        ezsurf      isosurface  
+      dellistener                  findall     linkprop   
+      diffuse                      gcbf        plotmatrix
+
+ ** New experimental OpenGL/FLTK based plotting system.
+
+    An experimental plotting system based on OpenGL and the FLTK
+    toolkit is now part of Octave.  This graphics toolkit is disabled by
+    default.  You can switch to using it with the command
+
+        graphics_toolkit ("fltk")
+
+    for all future figures or for a particular figure with the command
+
+        graphics_toolkit (h, "fltk")
+
+    where "h" is a valid figure handle.
+
+ ** Functions providing direct access to gnuplot have been removed.
+
+    The functions __gnuplot_plot__, __gnuplot_set__, __gnuplot_raw__,
+     __gnuplot_show__, __gnuplot_replot__, __gnuplot_splot__,
+     __gnuplot_save_data__ and __gnuplot_send_inline_data__ have been
+     removed from Octave.  These function were incompatible with the
+     high level graphics handle code.
+
+ ** The Control, Finance and Quaternion functions have been removed.
+
+    These functions are now available as separate packages from
+
+      http://octave.sourceforge.net/packages.html
+
+    and can be reinstalled using the Octave package manager (see
+    the pkg function).
+
+ ** Specific sparse matrix functions removed.
+
+    The following functions, which handled only sparse matrices have
+    been removed.  Instead of calling these functions directly, you
+    should use the corresponding function without the "sp" prefix.
+
+      spatan2     spcumsum  spkron   spprod
+      spchol      spdet     splchol  spqr
+      spchol2inv  spdiag    splu     spsum
+      spcholinv   spfind    spmax    spsumsqk
+      spcumprod   spinv     spmin
+
+ ** Improvements to the debugger.
+
+    The interactive debugging features have been improved.  Stopping
+    on statements with dbstop should work correctly now.  Stepping
+    into and over functions, and stepping one statement at a time
+    (with dbstep) now works.  Moving up and down the call stack with
+    dbup and dbdown now works.  The dbstack function is now available
+    to print the current function call stack.  The new dbquit function
+    is available to exit the debugging mode.
+
+ ** Improved traceback error messages.
+
+    Traceback error messages are much more concise and easier to
+    understand.  They now display information about the function call
+    stack instead of the stack of all statements that were active at
+    the point of the error.
+
+ ** Object Oriented Programming.
+
+    Octave now includes OOP features and the user can create their own
+    class objects and overloaded functions and operators.  For
+    example, all methods of a class called "myclass" will be found in
+    a directory "@myclass" on the users path.  The class specific
+    versions of functions and operators take precedence over the
+    generic versions of these functions.
+
+    New functions related to OOP include
+
+      class  inferiorto  isobject  loadobj  methods  superiorto
+
+    See the Octave manual for more details.
+
+ ** Parsing of Command-style Functions.
+
+    Octave now parses command-style functions without needing to first
+    declare them with "mark_as_command".  The rules for recognizing a
+    command-style function calls are
+
+      * A command must appear as the first word in a statement,
+        followed by a space.
+
+      * The first character after the space must not be '=' or '('
+
+      * The next token after the space must not look like a binary
+        operator.
+
+    These rules should be mostly compatible with the way Matlab parses
+    command-style function calls and allow users to define commands in
+    .m files without having to mark them as commands.
+
+    Note that previous versions of Octave allowed expressions like
+
+      x = load -text foo.dat
+
+    but an expression like this will now generate a parse error.  In
+    order to assign the value returned by a function to a variable,
+    you must use the normal function call syntax:
+
+      x = load ("-text", "foo.dat");
+
+ ** Block comments.
+
+    Commented code can be between matching "#{" and "#}" or "%{" and
+    "%}" markers, even if the commented code spans several line.  This
+    allows blocks code to be commented, without needing to comment
+    each line.  For example,
+
+    function [s, t] = func (x, y)
+      s = 2 * x;
+    #{
+      s *= y;
+      t = y + x;
+    #}
+    endfunction
+
+    the lines "s *= y;" and "t = y + x" will not be executed.
+
+ ** If any subfunction in a file ends with "end" or "endfunction", then
+    they all must end that way.  Previously, Octave accepted
+
+      function main ()
+        ...
+      # no endfunction here.
+      function sub ()
+        ...
+      endfunction
+
+    but this is no longer allowed.
+
+ ** Special treatment in the parser of expressions like "a' * b".
+
+    In these cases the transpose is no longer explicitly formed and
+    BLAS libraries are called with the transpose flagged,
+    significantly improving performance for these kinds of
+    operations.
+
+ ** Single Precision data type.
+
+    Octave now includes a single precision data type.  Single
+    precision variables can be created with the "single" command, or
+    from functions like ones, eye, etc.  For example,
+
+      single (1)
+      ones (2, 2, "single")
+      zeros (2, 2, "single")
+      eye (2, 2, "single")
+      Inf (2, 2, "single")
+      NaN (2, 2, "single")
+      NA (2, 2, "single")
+
+    all create single precision variables.  For compatibility with
+    Matlab, mixed double/single precision operators and functions
+    return single precision types.
+
+    As a consequence of this addition to Octave the internal
+    representation of the double precision NA value has changed, and
+    so users that make use of data generated by Octave with R or
+    visa-versa are warned that compatibility might not be assured.
+
+ ** Improved array indexing.
+
+    The underlying code used for indexing of arrays has been
+    completely rewritten and indexing is now significantly faster.
+
+ ** Improved memory management.
+
+    Octave will now attempt to share data in some cases where previously
+    a copy would be made, such as certain array slicing operations or
+    conversions between cells, structs and cs-lists.  This usually reduces
+    both time and memory consumption.
+    Also, Octave will now attempt to detect and optimize usage of a vector 
+    as a stack, when elements are being repeatedly inserted at/removed from 
+    the end of the vector.
+
+ ** Improved performance for reduction operations.
+
+    The performance of the sum, prod, sumsq, cumsum, cumprod, any, all,
+    max and min functions has been significantly improved.
+
+ ** Sorting and searching.
+    
+    The performance of sort has been improved, especially when sorting
+    indices are requested.  An efficient built-in issorted
+    implementation was added.  The sortrows function now uses a more
+    efficient algorithm, especially in the homogeneous case.  The lookup
+    function is now a built-in function performing a binary search,
+    optimized for long runs of close elements.  Lookup also works with
+    cell arrays of strings.
+
+ ** Range arithmetics
+
+    For some operations on ranges, Octave will attempt to keep the
+    result as a range.  These include negation, adding a scalar,
+    subtracting a scalar, and multiplying by a scalar.  Ranges with zero
+    increment are allowed and can be constructed using the built-in
+    function `ones'.
+
+ ** Various performance improvements.
+
+    Performance of a number of other built-in operations and functions
+    was improved, including:
+
+    * logical operations
+    * comparison operators
+    * element-wise power
+    * accumarray
+    * cellfun
+    * isnan
+    * isinf
+    * isfinite
+    * nchoosek
+    * repmat
+    * strcmp
+
+ ** 64-bit integer arithmetic.
+
+    Arithmetic with 64-bit integers (int64 and uint64 types) is fully
+    supported, with saturation semantics like the other integer types.
+    Performance of most integer arithmetic operations has been
+    improved by using integer arithmetic directly.  Previously, Octave
+    performed integer math with saturation semantics by converting the
+    operands to double precision, performing the operation, and then
+    converting the result back to an integer value, truncating if
+    necessary.
+
+ ** Diagonal and permutation matrices.
+
+    The interpreter can now treat diagonal and permutation matrices as
+    special objects that store only the non-zero elements, rather than
+    general full matrices.  Therefore, it is now possible to construct
+    and use these matrices in linear algebra without suffering a
+    performance penalty due to storing large numbers of zero elements.
+
+ ** Improvements to fsolve.
+
+    The fsolve function now accepts an option structure argument (see
+    also the optimset function).  The INFO values returned from fsolve
+    have changed to be compatible with Matlab's fsolve function.
+    Additionally, fsolve is now able to solve overdetermined systems,
+    complex-differentiable complex systems, systems with a sparse
+    jacobian and can work in single precision if given single precision
+    inputs.  It can also be called recursively.
+
+ ** Improvements to the norm function.
+
+    The norm function is now able to compute row or column norms of a
+    matrix in a single call, as well as general matrix p-norms.
+
+ ** New functions for computing some eigenvalues or singular values.
+
+    The eigs and svds functions have been included in Octave.  These
+    functions require the ARPACK library (now distributed under a
+    GPL-compatible license).
+
+ ** New QR and Cholesky factorization updating functions.
+
+      choldelete  cholshift   qrdelete  qrshift
+      cholinsert  cholupdate  qrinsert  qrupdate
+
+ ** New quadrature functions.
+
+      dblquad  quadgk  quadv  triplequad
+
+ ** New functions for reading and writing images.
+
+    The imwrite and imread functions have been included in Octave.
+    These functions require the GraphicsMagick library.  The new
+    function imfinfo provides information about an image file (size,
+    type, colors, etc.)
+
+ ** The input_event_hook function has been replaced by the pair of
+    functions add_input_event_hook and remove_input_event_hook so that
+    more than one hook function may be installed at a time.
+
+ ** Other miscellaneous new functions.
+
+      addtodate          hypot                       reallog
+      bicgstab           idivide                     realpow
+      cellslices         info                        realsqrt
+      cgs                interp1q                    rectint
+      command_line_path  isdebugmode                 regexptranslate
+      contrast           isfloat                     restoredefaultpath
+      convn              isstrprop                   roundb
+      cummin             log1p                       rundemos
+      cummax             lsqnonneg                   runlength
+      datetick           matlabroot                  saveobj
+      display            namelengthmax               spaugment
+      expm1              nargoutchk                  strchr
+      filemarker         pathdef                     strvcat
+      fstat              perl                        subspace
+      full               prctile                     symvar
+      fzero              quantile                    treelayout
+      genvarname         re_read_readline_init_file  validatestring
+      histc
+
+ ** Changes to strcat.
+
+    The strcat function is now compatible with Matlab's strcat
+    function, which removes trailing whitespace when concatenating
+    character strings.  For example
+
+      strcat ('foo ', 'bar')
+      ==> 'foobar'
+
+    The new function cstrcat provides the previous behavior of
+    Octave's strcat.
+
+ ** Improvements to the help functions.
+
+    The help system has been mostly re-implemented in .m files to make
+    it easier to modify.  Performance of the lookfor function has been
+    greatly improved by caching the help text from all functions that
+    are distributed with Octave.  The pkg function has been modified
+    to generate cache files for external packages when they are
+    installed.
+
+ ** Deprecated functions.
+
+    The following functions were deprecated in Octave 3.0 and will be
+    removed from Octave 3.4 (or whatever version is the second major
+    release after 3.0):
+

+      geometric_cdf    pascal_cdf
+      geometric_inv    pascal_inv
+
+    The following functions are now deprecated in Octave 3.2 and will
+    be removed from Octave 3.6 (or whatever version is the second major
+    release after 3.2):
+
+      create_set          spcholinv  spmax

It is the one thing that users have requested most often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided against delaying the release of all these new improvements any longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Need Your Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that you can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts alike (links will open an external browser):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by contributing your time to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/get-involved.html&quot;&gt;develop Octave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/bugs.html&quot;&gt;report problems &lt;/a&gt; that you find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether you are a user or developer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;help to fund the project&lt;/a&gt;.

+        <source>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Note about Octave&apos;s New GUI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest new features for Octave 3.8 is a graphical user interface.  It is the one thing that users have requested most often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided against delaying the release of all these new improvements any longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Need Your Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that you can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts alike (links will open an external browser):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by contributing your time to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/get-involved.html&quot;&gt;develop Octave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/bugs.html&quot;&gt;report problems &lt;/a&gt; that you find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether you are a user or developer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;help to fund the project&lt;/a&gt;.  Octave development takes a lot of time and expertise.  Your contributions help to ensure that Octave will continue to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you find Octave to be useful.  Please help us make it even better for the future!&lt;/p&gt;</source>
+        <translation>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nota acerca de la nueva GUI de Octave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Una de las novedades mas grandes para Octave 3.8 es la interfaz gráfica de usuario.  Esto ha sido algo que los usuarios han solicitado comúnmente durante los últimos años y ahora está casi lista. Pero como esta interfaz no ha sido aun tan pulida como a nosotros nos gustaría, hemos decidido esperar hasta la serie de la versión 4.0.x de Octave para hacer a la GUI de Octave la interfaz por defecto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dado el tiempo y el número de arreglos de los errores del software (bugs) y de las mejoras desde la última versión de lanzamiento importante de Octave, también hemos decidido refutar todo retraso en el lanzamiento de todas estas nuevas mejoras durante mas tiempo con el fin de perfeccionar la GUI.  Así que disfrute de la versión 3.8 de Octave y la versión previa de la nueva GUI.  Creemos que está funcionando razonablemente bien, pero también estamos conscientes de que existen muchas cosas que se pueden mejorar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Necesitamos Su Ayuda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hay varias maneras con las cuales usted nos puede ayudar a arreglar los problemas restantes, completar la GUI, y en general mejorar la experiencia del usuario, ya sean novatos o expertos por igual (las ligas abriran en un navegador externo):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Si usted es un desarrollador de software experimentado, puede contribuir con su tiempo para ayudar &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/get-involved.html&quot;&gt;Desarrollo de Octave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Si Octave no funciona adecuadamente, se le invita a  &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/bugs.html&quot;&gt;reportar problemas &lt;/a&gt; que haya encontrado.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Si usted es usuario o desarrollador, usted puede &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;ayudar a financiar el proyecto&lt;/a&gt;.  El desarrollo de Octave toma tiempo y muchas habilidades. Su contribución ayudaría en gran medida a asegurar que Octave continúe mejorando.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esperamos que haya encontrado Octave muy útil. Por favor ayúdenos a hacerlo aun mejor en el futuro!&lt;/p&gt;</translation>

+        <source>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Note about Octave&apos;s New GUI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest new features for Octave 3.8 is a graphical user interface.  It is the one thing that users have requested most often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided against delaying the release of all these new improvements any longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Need Your Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that you can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts alike (links will open an external browser):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by contributing your time to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/get-involved.html&quot;&gt;develop Octave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/bugs.html&quot;&gt;report problems &lt;/a&gt; that you find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether you are a user or developer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;help to fund the project&lt;/a&gt;.  Octave development takes a lot of time and expertise.  Your contributions help to ensure that Octave will continue to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you find Octave to be useful.  Please help us make it even better for the future!&lt;/p&gt;</source>

+        <source>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Note about Octave&apos;s New GUI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest new features for Octave 3.8 is a graphical user interface.  It is the one thing that users have requested most often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided against delaying the release of all these new improvements any longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Need Your Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that you can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts alike (links will open an external browser):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by contributing your time to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/get-involved.html&quot;&gt;develop Octave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/bugs.html&quot;&gt;report problems &lt;/a&gt; that you find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether you are a user or developer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;help to fund the project&lt;/a&gt;.

+        <source>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Note about Octave&apos;s New GUI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest new features for Octave 3.8 is a graphical user interface.  It is the one thing that users have requested most often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided against delaying the release of all these new improvements any longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Need Your Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that you can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts alike (links will open an external browser):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by contributing your time to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/get-involved.html&quot;&gt;develop Octave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/bugs.html&quot;&gt;report problems &lt;/a&gt; that you find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether you are a user or developer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;help to fund the project&lt;/a&gt;.  Octave development takes a lot of time and expertise.  Your contributions help to ensure that Octave will continue to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you find Octave to be useful.  Please help us make it even better for the future!&lt;/p&gt;</source>

+        <source>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Note about Octave&apos;s New GUI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest new features for Octave 3.8 is a graphical user interface.  It is the one thing that users have requested most often over the last few years and now it is almost ready.  But because it is not quite as polished as we would like, we have decided to wait until the 4.0.x release series before making the GUI the default interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the length of time and the number of bug fixes and improvements since the last major release Octave, we also decided against delaying the release of all these new improvements any longer just to perfect the GUI.  So please enjoy the 3.8 release of Octave and the preview of the new GUI.  We believe it is working reasonably well, but we also know that there are some obvious rough spots and many things that could be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Need Your Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways that you can help us fix the remaining problems, complete the GUI, and improve the overall user experience for both novices and experts alike (links will open an external browser):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are a skilled software developer, you can help by contributing your time to help &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/get-involved.html&quot;&gt;develop Octave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Octave does not work properly, you are encouraged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/bugs.html&quot;&gt;report problems &lt;/a&gt; that you find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether you are a user or developer, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://octave.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;help to fund the project&lt;/a&gt;.  Octave development takes a lot of time and expertise.  Your contributions help to ensure that Octave will continue to improve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you find Octave to be useful.  Please help us make it even better for the future!&lt;/p&gt;</source>
