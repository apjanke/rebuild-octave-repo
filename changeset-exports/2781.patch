 <h2>Summary of changes for version 2.0.4</h2>
 
 <ul>
 <li>It is now possible to use commands like ls, save, and cd as simple
     variable names.  They still cannot be used as formal parameters
     for functions, or as the names of structure variables.  Failed
     assignments leave them undefined (you can recover the orginal
     function definition using clear).
