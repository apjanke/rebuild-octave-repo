 Sometimes during development there is a test that should work but is
 known to fail.  You still want to leave the test in because when the
 final code is ready the test should pass, but you may not be able to
 fix it immediately.  To avoid unecessary bug reports for these known
 failures, mark the block with @code{xtest} rather than @code{test}:
 
 @example
-   %!xtest error ("This test is known to fail.")
+   %!xtest assert (1==0)
+   %!xtest fail ('success=1','error'))
 @end example
 
 Another use of @code{xtest} is for statistical tests which should
 pass most of the time but are known to fail occasionally.
 
 Each block is evaluated in its own function environment, which means
 that variables defined in one block are not automatically shared
 with other blocks.  If you do want to share variables, then you
