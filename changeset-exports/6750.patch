-This means that in general the 'spline' method results in smooth
-results. If the function to be interpolated is in fact smooth, then
-'spline' will give excellent results. However, if the function to be
-evaluated is in some manner discontinuous, then 'cubic' or 'pchip'

 Fourier interpolation, is a resampling technique where a signal is
 converted to the frequency domain, padded with zeros and then
 reconverted to the time domain.

 There are two significant limitations on Fourier interpolation. Firstly,
 the function signal is assumed to be periodic, and so no periodic

 To correct this behavior would mean that zero elements with a negative

 sign-bit was respected. This is not done at this time, for reasons of

 In general any function or operator used on a sparse matrix will
 result in a sparse matrix with the same or a larger number of non-zero
 elements than the original matrix. This is particularly true for the
 important case of sparse matrix factorizations. The usual way to
 address this is to reorder the matrix, such that its factorization is
 sparser than the factorization of the original matrix. That is the
