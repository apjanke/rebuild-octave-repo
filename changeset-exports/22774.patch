 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 4.2:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
  ** The parser has been extended to accept, but ignore, underscore
     characters in numbers.  This facilitates writing more legible code
     by using '_' as a thousands separator or to group nibbles into bytes
     in hex constants.

     deprecated in Octave 4.0 and will be removed from Octave 4.4 (or
     whatever version is the second major release after 4.0).  Use the
     Fatan2 function with sparse inputs as a replacement.
 
  ** The internal class Octave_map was deprecated in Octave 3.8 and has
     been removed from Octave 4.0.  Replacement classes are octave_map
     (struct array) or octave_scalar_map for a single structure.
 
- ** The configure option --enable-octave-allocator has been removed.
-    The internal class octave_allocator declared in oct-alloc.h has been
-    removed.  The header remains, but is deprecated.  The macros to
-    access the class (DECLARE_OCTAVE_ALLOCATOR, DEFINE_OCTAVE_ALLOCATOR,
-    and DEFINE_OCTAVE_ALLOCATOR2) are now unconditionally defined to be
-    empty.

  ** Octave now has OpenMP enabled by default if the system provides a
     working OpenMP implementation.  This allows oct-file modules to take
     advantage of OpenMP if desired.  This can be disabled when building
     Octave with the configure option --disable-openmp.
 
  ** Octave now automatically truncates intermediate calculations done
     with floating point values to 64 bits.  Some hardware math
     co-processors, such as the x87, maintain extra precision, but this
