 @chapter What's new in version 2.0 of Octave
 
 Version 2.0.10 of Octave was released February 6, 1998.  Most bugs
 reported since version 2.0 was release have been fixed, and a number of
 new features have been added.  Octave is now much more compatible with
 @sc{Matlab}.
 
 A list of user-visible changes in recent versions of Octave may be found

 Octave.

 When running interactively, Octave saves the commands you type in an
 internal buffer so that you can recall and edit them.  Emacs and vi
 editing modes are available with Emacs keybindings enabled by default.
 
 When Octave exits, the current command history is saved to the file
 @file{~/.octave_hist}, and each time Octave starts, it inserts the
 contents of the @file{~/.octave_hist} file in the history list so that
 it is easy to begin working where you left off.

 you don't build shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do not
