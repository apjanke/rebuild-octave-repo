 If your system does not support IEEE arithmetic but Octave's configure
 script incorrectly determined that it does, you can work around the
 problem by editing the file @file{config.h} to not define
 @code{HAVE_ISINF}, @code{HAVE_FINITE}, and @code{HAVE_ISNAN}.
 
 In any case, please report this as a bug since it might be possible to
 modify Octave's configuration script to automatically determine the
 proper thing to do.

+After installing the binary distribution of Octave in an alternate
+directory, the Emacs command @code{run-octave} doesn't work.  Emacs
+hangs in @code{accept-process-output} in @code{inferior-octave-startup}.
+
+This seems to be a problem with executing a shell script using the
+comint package.  You can avoid the problem by changing the way Octave is
+installed to eliminate the need for the shell script.  You can either
+compile and install Octave using the source distribution, reinstall the
+binary distribution in the default directory, or copy the commands in
+the octave shell script wrapper to your shell startup files (and the
+shell startup files for anyone else who is using Octave) and then
+rename the file @file{octave.bin} to be @file{octave}.

 Although Octave is not very difficult to build from its sources, it is a
 relatively large program that does require a significant amount of time
 and disk space to compile and install.  Because of this, many people
