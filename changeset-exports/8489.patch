 Note that the matrix type will be discovered automatically on the first attempt to\n\
 solve a linear equation involving @var{a}. Therefore @code{matrix_type} is only\n\
 useful to give Octave hints of the matrix type. Incorrectly defining the\n\
 matrix type will result in incorrect results from solutions of linear equations,\n\

+Also the test for positive definiteness is a low-cost test for a hermitian\n\
 matrix with a real positive diagonal. This does not guarantee that the matrix\n\
 is positive definite, but only that it is a probable candidate. When such a\n\
 matrix is factorized, a Cholesky factorization is first attempted, and if\n\
 that fails the matrix is then treated with an LU factorization. Once the\n\
 matrix has been factorized, @code{matrix_type} will return the correct\n\
 classification of the matrix.\n\
