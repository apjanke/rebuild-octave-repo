 It is possible to build Octave on Windows systems with Cygwin,
 but with standard gcc-3.4.4-3 compiler there are some performance
 problems related to the way C++ exception handling is implemented.
 This is a known problem with a long history so it is suggested to use
 version gcc-4.3.2-1 or later.
 
 Binary version 3.0.2-2 is built with gcc-4.3.2-1

-the package list in Cygwin's setup.exe installer if you would like to

     The binaries here are built using gcc-3.4.4-3 configured with
     --disable-sjlj-exceptions.  Performance is improved by using DWARF
     exception handling instead of setjump/longjump exception
