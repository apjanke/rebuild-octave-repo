 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.6:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
  ** The PCRE library is now required to build Octave.
 
+ ** Octave now features a profiler, thanks to the work of Daniel Kraft
+    under the Google Summer of Code mentorship program. The manual has
+    been updated to reflect this addition.
+
  ** strread, textscan, and textread have been completely revamped.
 
     They now support nearly all Matlab functionality including:
 
     * ML-compatible whitespace and delimiter defaults
 
     * ML-compatible options: 'whitespace', treatasempty',
     format string repeat count, user-specified comment style, uneven-length
