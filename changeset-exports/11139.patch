 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.4:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
- ** The fltk graphics backend now implements the following callback
-    properties: keypressfcn, keyreleasefcn, windowbuttondownfcn,
-    windowbuttonmotionfcn, windowbuttonupfcn, and currentpoint.  These
-    enable keyboard and mouse interaction, an example of which can be
-    seen in the __fltk_ginput__.m script.
-
  ** BLAS and LAPACK libraries are now required to build Octave.  The
     subset of the reference BLAS and LAPACK libraries has been removed
     from the Octave sources.
 
  ** The `lookup' function was extended to be more useful for
     general-purpose binary searching.  Using this improvement, the
     ismember function was rewritten for significantly better
     performance.

  ** Functions providing direct access to gnuplot have been removed.
 
     The functions __gnuplot_plot__, __gnuplot_set__, __gnuplot_raw__,
      __gnuplot_show__, __gnuplot_replot__, __gnuplot_splot__,
      __gnuplot_save_data__ and __gnuplot_send_inline_data__ have been
      removed from Octave.  These function were incompatible with the
      high level graphics handle code.
