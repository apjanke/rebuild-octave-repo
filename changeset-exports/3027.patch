 Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed.
 
-There are two new features:
-
-  * The new built-in variable default_eval_print_flag controls whether
-    Octave prints the results of commands executed by eval() that do
-    not end with semicolons.  The default is 1.
-
-  * The new built-in constant OCTAVE_HOME specifies the top-level
-    directory where Octave is installed.
+This is a bug-fixing release.  There are no new features.
 
 Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
 numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
