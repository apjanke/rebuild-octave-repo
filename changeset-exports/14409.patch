  ** The ARPACK library is no longer distributed with Octave.
     If you need the eigs or svds functions you must provide an
     external ARPACK through a package manager or by compiling it
     yourself.  If a pre-compiled package does not exist for your system,
     you can find the current ARPACK sources at

     Functions have been made Matlab-compatible with regard to special
