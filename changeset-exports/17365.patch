     would search the variable str for a TAB character (escape sequence \t)
     and replace it with a NEWLINE (escape sequence \n).  Previously the
     expression would have searched for a literal '\' followed by 't' and
     replaced the two characters with the sequence '\', 'n'.
 
+ ** A TeX parser has been implemented for the FLTK toolkit and is the default
+    for any text object including titles and axis labels.  The TeX parser is
+    supported only for display on a monitor, not for printing.

  ** The m-files in the image directory have been overhauled.
 
     The principal benefit is that Octave will now no longer automatically
     convert images stored with integers to doubles.  Storing images as uint8
     or uint16 requires only 1/8 or 1/4 the memory of an image stored using
     doubles.  For certain operations, such as fft2, the image must still be
     converted to double in order to work.
