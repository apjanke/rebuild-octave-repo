-Octave has been mostly ported to Windows NT and Windows 95 using the
-beta 17 release of the Cygnus GNU-WIN32 tools.  Not everything works,
-but it is usable.  If you would like to volunteer to work on
-improving this port, please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
-
-Here is a list of current problems (and workarounds, where available).
-
-* There is no binary version of Octave available for Windows NT or
-  Windows 95.  One will probably be released when the port is a little
-  more stable.
-
-* To compile and install Octave on a Windows NT or Windows 95 system,
-  you will need to get the beta 17 release of the GNU-WIN32 tools.  They
-  are available from ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32.
-
-* There is a conflict between the files /cygnus/include/g++/String.h and
-  /cygnus/H-i386-cygwin32/i386-cygwin32/include/stringh.  You should
-  rename or remove /cygnus/include/g++/String.h.  (These file names
-  assume that you have installed the GNU-WIN32 tools in /cygnus).
-
-* On Windows 95 systems, there is a bug that causes redirections to
-  /dev/null to fail.  You can work around the problem by substituting
-  /dev/nul for /dev/null in all of the files that use it.
-
-* You will need to have f2c and libf2c.a or g77 installed.  You can get
-  a copy of f2c from ftp://netlib.att.com/netlib/f2c.
-
-* You will also need a termcap library.  The GNU termcap library seems
-  to work.  You can get it from any GNU archive site, including 
-  ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/termcap-1.3.tar.gz.
-
-* GNU info doesn't work yet.  It compiles but doesn't run.  Perhaps the
-  problem is just that a proper termcap entry needs to be defined.
-
-* If you have a working version of less, the pager will probably work.
-  The GNU-WIN32 tools used to include a copy of less, but I am told it
-  was dropped from the distribution because it didn't work very well.
-
-* To make plotting work, you will need to find a version of gnuplot
-  that can read commands from a pipe.  The binary versions of gnuplot
-  for Windows that I found could only read from their command windows,
-  and wouldn't accept commands through a pipe, so they could not be
-  called from Octave.
-
-  After deleting -DREADLINE from the Makefile, I was able to compile a
-  working version of gnuplot 3.6 beta 315 using the GNU-WIN32 tools,
-  but it does not support the Windows graphics terminal.  It does
-  support dumb terminals and lots of other output devices, including
-  PostScript, but it would be much nicer if it could open a separate
-  window and draw pretty graphs there.
-
-
-If you know of solutions for any of these problems, please contact
-bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
-
-More information about the GNU-WIN32 project is available via the WWW
-at http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32.
