 @section Running Octave
 
 On most systems, the way to invoke Octave is with the shell command
 @samp{octave}.  Octave displays an initial message and then a prompt
 indicating it is ready to accept input.  You can begin typing Octave
 commands immediately afterward.
 
 If you get into trouble, you can usually interrupt Octave by typing
-@kbd{Control-C} (usually written @kbd{C-c} for short).  @kbd{C-c} gets

 prompt.
