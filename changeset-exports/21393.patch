 ## Instead of specifying polygons by matrices @var{x} and @var{y}, it is
 ## possible to present a unique list of vertices and then a list of polygon
 ## faces created from those vertices.  In this case the
 ## @qcode{"Vertices"} matrix will be an @nospell{Nx2} (2-D patch) or

+## @nospell{Nx3} (3-D patch).  The @nospell{MxN} @qcode{"Faces"} matrix
 ## describes M polygons having N vertices---each row describes a
 ## single polygon and each column entry is an index into the
 ## @qcode{"Vertices"} matrix to identify a vertex.  The patch object
 ## can be created by directly passing the property/value pairs
 ## @qcode{"Vertices"}/@var{verts}, @qcode{"Faces"}/@var{faces} as
 ## inputs.
 ##
 ## A third input form is to create a structure @var{fv} with the fields
