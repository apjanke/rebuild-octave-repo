@@ -148,23 +148,21 @@ Sparse Matrices:
     The fact is that this doesn't make sense in any case as the assign
     function makes another copy of the sparse matrix. So although spalloc
     might easily be made to have the correct behaviour, the first assign
     will cause the matrix to be resized !!! There seems to be no simple
     way to treat this but a complete rewrite of the sparse assignment
     functions...
