 @node Sets
 @chapter Sets
 
 Octave has a number of functions for managing sets of data.  A set is defined
 as a collection of unique elements and is typically represented by a vector of
 numbers sorted in ascending order.  Any vector or matrix can be converted to a
 set by removing duplicates through the use of the @code{unique} function.

 The real and complex @code{ColumnVector} and @code{RowVector} classes
 all have the following functions.  These will eventually be part of an
 @code{MArray<T>} class, derived from the @code{Array<T>} class.  Then
 the @code{ColumnVector} and @code{RowVector} classes will be derived
 from the @code{MArray<T>} class.
