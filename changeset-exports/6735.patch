 Octave takes a long time to find symbols.
 
 Octave uses the @code{genpath} function to recursively add directories
 to the list of directories searched for function files. Check the list
 of directories with the @code{path} command. If the path list is very

 A large number of the @sc{Matlab} core functions (ie those that are in

 @sc{Matlab} includes a "Just-In-Time" compiler. This compiler allows the
 acceleration of for-loops in @sc{Matlab} to almost native performance with
 certain restrictions. The JIT must know the return type of all functions
 called in the loops and so you can't include user functions in the loop
 of JIT optimized loops. Octave doesn't have a JIT and so to some might
