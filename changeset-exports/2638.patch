+  * Octave now stops executing commands from a script file if an error
+    is encountered.
+
+  * The return, and break commands now cause Octave to quit executing
+    commands from script files.  When used in invalid contexts, the
+    break, continue, and return commands are now simply ignored
+    instead of producing parse errors.
+
+  * size ("") is now [0, 0].
+
+  * New functions:

+      sleep   -- pause execution for a specified number of seconds
+      usleep  -- pause execution for a specified number of microseconds

 Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
 numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with Matlab.

 Binary distributions:
 --------------------
 
 Binaries for several popular systems are distributed along with the
-source, and are available in the following subdirectories of
-/pub/octave/BINARIES:
-
-  subdirectory            binary compiled on
-  -----------------------------------------------------------------
-  alpha-dec-osf1.3        DEC Alpha/OSF1
-  mips-dec-ultrix4.2      DECstation running Ultrix 4.2
-  rs6000-ibm-aix3.2.5     RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.5
-  sparc-sun-sunos4.1.2    Sun SPARC running SunOS 4.1.2
+source, and are available in subdirectories of /pub/octave/BINARIES.
 
 Note:
 
-  * Binary distributions for Octave 2.0 will be available when there
+  * Binary distributions for Octave 2.0.x will be available when there
     is time to create them.  We depend on volunteers to make binaries
     for most systems.  If you would like to help out, please contact
-    bug-octavebevo.che.wisc.edu.
+    bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
 
   * Gnuplot binaries are *not* included.  For the plotting commands to
     work, you will need to install gnuplot on your system.  See the
     file INSTALL.octave in the top level directory of the distribution
     for more details.
 
   * Octave has been compiled assuming that you have `less' installed.
     You can use the environment variable PAGER to choose another pager.
 
-  * We only have a limited amount of time available to devote to
-    making binaries, so binaries may not be immediately available
-    for some platforms.  Please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu if
-    you are interested in helping make binary distributions available.

 A note about .gz files:
 ----------------------
 
 Files with names ending in `.gz' have been compressed with `gzip'.
 
 Unlike the compress utility, gzip is free of any known software
 patents and tends to compress better anyway.  Gzip can uncompress
 `compress'-compressed files too, so you can install it as "uncompress"
