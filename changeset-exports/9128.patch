     completely rewritten and indexing is now significantly faster.
 
  ** Improved memory management.
 
     Octave will now attempt to share data in some cases where previously
     a copy would be made, such as certain array slicing operations or
     conversions between cells, structs and cs-lists.  This usually reduces
     both time and memory consumption.
+    Also, Octave will now attempt to detect and optimize usage of a vector 
+    as a stack, when elements are being repeatedly inserted at/removed from 
+    the end of the vector.
 
  ** Improved performance for reduction operations.
 
     The performance of the sum, prod, sumsq, cumsum, cumprod, any, all,
     max and min functions has been significantly improved.
 
  ** Sorting and searching.
