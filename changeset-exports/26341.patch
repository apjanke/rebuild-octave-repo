     for plots.  This device is only available with the gnuplot toolkit.
 
  ** Printing to EPS files now uses a tight bounding box ("-tight"
     argument to print) by default.  This makes more sense for EPS
     files which are normally embedded within other documents, and is
     Matlab compatible.  If necessary use the "-loose" option to
     reproduce figures as they appeared in previous versions of Octave.
 
+ ** Specifying legend position with a numeric argument is deprecated and
+    will be removed in Octave 7.0.  Use a string argument instead.
+
  ** It is now possible to use files and folders containing Unicode
     characters in Windows.
 
  ** The GUI requires Qt libraries.  The minimum Qt4 version supported is
     Qt4.8.  Qt5 of any version is preferred.
 
  ** The FFTW library is now required to perform FFT calculations.
     The FFTPACK sources have been removed from Octave.
