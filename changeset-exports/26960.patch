 %% FIXME: Can't use 'clear -classes' because it also clears all functions in the
 %% namespace of test.m (bug #35881).  This is a problem only if Octave would
 %% re-use a class definition that was defined somewhere else.  Unfortunately,
 %% that is exactly the case when running 'make check' since the ctor-vs-method
 %% test also uses an @parent, @derived, and @other class.
 %% Until the bug is fixed, it suffices to make the class names unique so that
-%% there is no re-use.  Using the prefix fhdr (fcn-handle-derived-resolution)
+%% there is no re-use.  Using the prefix fhdr (fcn-handle/derived-resolution)
