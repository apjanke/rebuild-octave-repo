 function [y, w] = filter(b,a,x,w)
 
 # Filter a vector.
 # y = filter(b,a,x) returns the solution to the following linear,
 # time-invariant difference equation:
 # 
 #    N                   M
-#   sum a(k+1) y(n-k) + sum b(k+1) x(n-k) = 0  for 1<=n<=length(x)
+#   sum a(k+1) y(n-k) = sum b(k+1) x(n-k)            for 1<=n<=length(x)
 #   k=0                 k=0
 # 
 # where N=length(a)-1 and M=length(b)-1. An equivalent form of this
 # equation is:
 # 
-#           N                   M
-#   y(n) = sum c(k+1) y(n-k) + sum d(k+1) x(n-k)  for 1<=n<=length(x)
-#          k=1                 k=0				     
+#             N                   M
+#   y(n) = - sum c(k+1) y(n-k) + sum d(k+1) x(n-k)   for 1<=n<=length(x)
+#            k=1                 k=0				     
 # 				  
 # where c = a/a(1) and d = b/a(1).
 # 
 # In terms of the z-transform, y is the result of passing the discrete-
 # time signal x through a system characterized by the following rational
 # system function:							
 # 									
 #              M
 #             sum d(k+1) z^(-k)
 #             k=0	       
 #   H(z) = ----------------------
 #                N
-#           1 + sum c(k+1) z(-k)
+#           1 + sum c(k+1) z^(-k)
 #               k=1
 # 
 # [y, sf] = filter(b,a,x,si) sets the initial state of the system, si,
 # and returns the final state, sf.  The state vector is a column vector
 # whose length is equal to the length of the longest coefficient vector
 # minus one.  If si is not set, the initial state vector is set to all
 # zeros.
