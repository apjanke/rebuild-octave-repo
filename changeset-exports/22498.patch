test: Mark acosh BIST tests with bug number 49091.

* mappers.cc (acosh): Mark BIST tests with bug number 49091.
Add FIXME explaining that we are letting this test fail until
the upstream std::acosh library is improved.

+## The decision now (9/15/2016) is to mark the test with a bug number so

 ##        around this, or wait until working version of libm is widespread?
