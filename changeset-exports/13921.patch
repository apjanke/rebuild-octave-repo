 * Working from the repository
 
 These notes are intended to help people working on sources checked-out from
 the savannah source code repository.

 ** Requirements
 
 We've opted to keep only the highest-level sources in the repository.
 This eases our maintenance burden, (fewer merges, etc.), but imposes
 more requirements on anyone wishing to build from the just-checked-out
 sources.  For example, you have to use the latest stable versions of
 the maintainer tools we depend upon, including:
