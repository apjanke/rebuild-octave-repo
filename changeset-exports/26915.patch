edit.m: unset HOME directory by default (bug #41278)

* edit.m: Set HOME directory to empty array by default to disable it.  Delete
most doc string references to copying function files into HOME.  Defer HOME
option documentation to the end.  Document how to restore previous behavior.
* NEWS: Document the change to the HOME setting and how to restore previous
behavior.

 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 6 (yyyy-mm-dd):
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 ### General improvements
 
-- The `edit` function option `"editinplace"` now defaults to `true`.
-  Files will no longer be copied to the user's HOME directory for
-  editing and then copied back to their original location.
+- The `edit` function option `"editinplace"` now defaults to `true` and
+  the option `"home"` now defaults to the empty matrix `[]`.  Files will
+  no longer be copied to the user's HOME directory for editing.  The old
+  behavior can be restored by setting `"editinplace"` to `false` and
+  `"home"` to `"~/octave"`.
 
 #### Graphics backend
 
 - Graphic primitives now accept a color property value of `"none"`
   which is useful when a particular primitive needs to be hidden
   (for example, the Y-axis of an axes object with `"ycolor" = "none"`)
   without hiding the entire primitive `"visibility" = "off"`.
 
 - A new property `"FontSmoothing"` has been added to text and axes
   objects that controls whether anti-aliasing is used during the
   rendering of characters.  The default is "on" which produces smooth,
-  more visually appealing text. 
+  more visually appealing text.
 
 - The appearance of patterned lines `"LineStyle" = ":"|"--"|"-."` has
   been improved for small widths (`"LineWidth"` less than 1.5 pixels)
   which is a common scenario.
 
 - Printing to EPS files now uses a tight bounding box (`"-tight"`
   argument to print) by default.  This makes more sense for EPS
   files which are normally embedded within other documents, and is
