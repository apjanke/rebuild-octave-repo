   * Make functions like gamma() return the right IEEE Inf or NaN

   * Support for lp_solve for linear programming problems.
 
-  * Free NLP solver.
+  * Improve sqp.
 
   * Fix CollocWt to handle Laguerre polynomials.  Make it easy to
     extend it to other polynomial types.
 
   * Add optional arguments to colloc so that it's not restricted to
     Legendre polynomials.
 
   * Fix eig to also be able to solve the generalized eigenvalue

 ------------
 
   * Make fread and fwrite work for complex data.  Iostreams based
     versions of these functions would also be nice, and if you are
     working on them, it would be good to support other size
     specifications (integer*2, etc.).
 
-  * Make fread and fopen look in the load path for files.
-
   * Move some pr-output stuff to liboctave.
 
   * Make the cutoff point for changing to packed storage a
     user-preference variable with default value 8192.
 
   * Make it possible to load other image formats (ppm, pbm, etc. would
     probably be best since there are already filters to convert to
     these formats from others.)

   * Handle multi-line input at the keyboard/debug prompt correctly.
 
   * Fix the parser so that
 
       if (expr) 'this is a string' end
 
     is parsed as IF expr STRING END.
 
-  * Consider grouping all preference variables in a structure instead
-    of further polluting the namespace.  Maybe `Octave_options.xxx'?
+  * Clean up functions in input.cc that handle user input (there
+    currently seems to be some unnecessary duplication of code and it
+    seems overly complex).
 
   * Consider allowing an arbitrary property list to be attached to any
     variable.  This could be a more general way to handle the help
     string that can currently be added with `document'.
 
   * Allow more command line options to be accessible as built-in
     variables (--echo-commands, etc.).
