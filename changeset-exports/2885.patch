 Octave's manual has been revised for version 2.0, but it is lagging a
 bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is
 currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries or the

 bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.  Specific suggestions for ways to
 improve Octave and its documentation are always welcome.

 It may also be possible to install it using other implementations of
 these tools, but it will most certainly require much more work.  Do
 yourself a favor and get the GNU development tools, either via
