 Documentation
 -------------
 
 Octave's manual has been revised for version 3.4, but it is lagging a
 bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is
 currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries.  If
 you notice omissions or inconsistencies, please report them on the
-bug tracker at http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=octave.  Specific
-suggestions for ways to improve Octave and its documentation are
-always welcome.  Reports with patches are even more welcome.
