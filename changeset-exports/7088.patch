 Overview
 --------
 
 GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
 computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
 solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

 To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You

-libstdc++ is distributed along with libg++, but for later versions,
-libstdc++ is distributed separately.  For egcs, libstdc++ is included

+You will also need a Fortran 77 compiler or f2c.  If you use f2c, you

 YOU MUST HAVE GNU MAKE TO COMPILE OCTAVE.  Octave's Makefiles use
 features of GNU Make that are not present in other versions of make.
 GNU Make is very portable and easy to install.

 specific installation instructions, including directions for
 installing Octave from a binary distribution.

+Octave's manual has been revised for version 3.0, but it is lagging a
 bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is
-currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries or the
-support for dynamic linking and user-defined data types.  If you
-notice ommissions or inconsistencies, please report them as bugs to
-bug@octave.org.  Specific suggestions for ways to improve Octave and
-its documentation are always welcome.
-
-Implementation
---------------
-
-Octave is being developed with the Free Software Foundation's make,
-bison (a replacement for YACC), flex (a replacement for lex), gcc/g++,
-and libstdc++ on an Intel Pentium II system running Linux/GNU.  It
-should be possible to install it on any machine that runs GCC/G++.  It
-may also be possible to install it using other implementations of
-these tools, but it will most certainly require much more work.  Do
-yourself a favor and get the GNU development tools, either via
-anonymous ftp from ftp.gnu.org or by writing the Free Software
-Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA
-02110-1301, USA.
-
-The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
-like Lapack, Linpack, Odepack, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
-of C++ classes (see the files in the libcruft and liboctave
-subdirectories).  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
-with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
-functions.  If that's not possible, they are translated with f2c and
-compiled with a C compiler.  Better performance is usually achieved if
-the intermediate translation to C is avoided.
-
-The library of C++ classes may also be useful by itself.
+currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries.  If
+you notice ommissions or inconsistencies, please report them as bugs

-Octave is now part of the normal net distribution of Cygwin, available
-from http://www.cygwin.com.  To install the Cygwin package of Octave:
-
- 1. Use your favorite browser to view the page http://www.cygwin.com
-
- 2. Click on the "Install or update now" link.
-
- 3. A dialog should appear with the option to run the setup program
-    from its current location or save it to disk.  Either will work,
-    but I usually choose to save the setup program to disk so that it
-    is possible to run it later to update the installation without
-    having to go back to the web page using a browser.
-
- 4. Run the setup program.
-
- 5. Choose "Install from Internet".
-
- 6. Select a root install directory.  You may choose any directory, but
-    it needs to have enough space for Octave and all the related
-    tools.  Sorry, I don't know how much space that is at present.
-
- 7. Select a local package directory.  This is a directory that the
-    setup program will use to temporarily store package files before
-    installing them.  It should have plenty of space (probably 70MB
-    or more).  You may delete this directory once the installation is
-    complete.
-
- 8. Select your Internet Connection.  Probably "Direct Connection" is
-    OK unless you are behind a firewall of some kind that limits your
-    access to the Internet.
+An obsolete version of Octave (2.1.73) is part of the normal net
+distribution of Cygwin, available from http://www.cygwin.com.  Check
+the package list in Cygwin's setup.exe installer if you would like to
+try using it.  However, 2.1.73 is unsupported and we STRONGLY
+recommended that you use a more recent version of Octave.
 
- 9. Choose a download site.  One that is "near" you on the net is
-    probably best.
-
-10. Select packages.  Choose Octave from the Math category and gnuplot
-    from the graphics category.
-
-11. Once the download and file installation is done, click Finish.  I
-    usually choose to create an icon on the desktop and put an icon in
-    the start menu.  After you click finish, a series of scripts will
-    run, displaying some output in a terminal window.  It will take a
-    few minutes.
-
-12. To run Octave, start Cygwin.  This will bring up a terminal
-    window.  In that window type
-
-      startx
-
-    (a running X server is needed for plotting).  Running startx will
-    bring up a new window.  In that window, type
-
-      octave
-
-    That should present you with an Octave prompt.  Type
-
-      sombrero (41)
-
-    at this prompt and a new window with the sombrero plot should appear.
-
-13. IMPORTANT: to build .oct files (dynamically loaded functions) for
-    Octave, you will also need the octave-headers package.  Currently,
-    due to some bugs in the most recent version of the C++ compiler
-    and libraries for Cygwin, you will also need gcc and g++ 3.3
-    rather than 3.4.  You can use the setup.exe installer to select
-    and install the older version.
+It should be possible to build Octave on Windows systems with Cygwin,
+but at the time of this writing, there are some performance problems
+related to the way C++ exception handling is implemented with the
+default Cygwin compiler.  This is a known problem with a long history.
+If you would like to see this problem corrected, please search the
+Cygwin mailing lists for threads related to "sjlj exception handling"
+(or similar).

-NOTE: This file was originally written several years ago, when many
-people were complaining that Octave would not work for them on Linux
-systems.  Generally, the problems were not actually bugs in Octave.
-More recently, the compilers are better, most distributions are more
-complete, and it seems harder to install incompatible sets of
-libraries or header files (but some people still manage to do it).
-
-Since July 1996, most work on Octave has been done using a Linux
-system, and a number of people who regularly test Octave snapshot
-releases also primarily use Linux systems.  Because of this, I believe
-Octave should run reasonably well on most current Linux systems.
-However, there have been some problems in the past, usually the result
-of improper installation of compilers or libraries.  Sometimes the
-problems have happened because of a botched upgrade or even a buggy
-Linux distribution.
-
-If you can, you should probably install Octave using one of the Debian
-or RPM packages for Octave that are available with the major Linux
-distributions.  For example, Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
-maintains the Debian Octave package and usually has them ready within
-a day or so of new Octave releases.  They are available via the WWW at
-http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages.
-
-If for some reason you can't (or choose not to) install Octave from
-one of the binary distributions or by using one of the Debian or RPM
-packages and something goes wrong, please check the following list to
-see if your problem is already well known before reporting a bug.
-
-Octave compiles, but it won't run
----------------------------------
-
-If you can compile Octave, but it crashes with a segmentation fault
-right away, you probably have incompatible versions of libc and
-libstdc++ installed, or you have a version of the dynamic loader,
-ld.so, that is incompatible with your versions of the libraries, or
-both.
-
-Octave won't even compile
--------------------------
+There are binary packages for Debian, Fedora, and other GNU/Linux
+distributions.
 
-If you can't compile Octave, you should first check to see that your
-compiler and header files are properly installed.  Do you have
-multiple versions of the g++ include files on your system?  Are you
-sure that your copy of g++ is finding the right set?  You can find out
-by compiling a simple C++ program with -v:
-
-bash$ cat foo.cc
-#include <iostream.h>
-int main (void) { cerr << "yo\n"; return 0; }
+Octave should build cleanly from source on most GNU/Linux systems.
 
-bash$ g++ -v foo.cc
-gcc -v foo.cc -lstdc++ -lm
-Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2/specs
-gcc version 2.7.2
- /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2/cpp -lang-c++ -v -undef ...
-#include "..." search starts here:
-#include <...> search starts here:
- /usr/lib/g++-include
- /usr/local/include
- /usr/i486-linux/include
- /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2/include
- /usr/include
-End of search list.
-...
-
-If the location of the correct set of include files is not listed in
-the search path, then you might be able to fix that with a symbolic
-link.  However, if your version of libstdc++ was not compiled with your
-current version of gcc, you are likely to run into more trouble.
-
-I/O in dynamically loaded .oct files doesn't work
--------------------------------------------------
-
-If Octave prints things like `%.-1e' instead of numbers when you use a
-dynamically linked .oct file, you probably need to create shared
-versions of the Octave libraries.  To do that, configure Octave with
---enable-shared, recompile, and reinstall.
-

-(2) Future work:
-=============
-Dynamic linking is apparently not yet supported, so .oct files cannot be used 
-(yet) in Power MachTen.
-
-(3) To install Octave on MachTen 4.1:
-=============
-Short instructions:  MachTen automatically defines __MACHTEN_PPC__ on
-power MachTen.  The octave configure script sets most everything up properly.
-Here's a few details that also need done:
-
-(a) Put libncurses into the Tenon Application Library Folder
-(b) Replace the MT /usr/bin/sed with gnu sed (I used 2-0.5).
-(c) <sys/signal.h>: Is fixed in MachTen 4.1.1
-(d) Set virtual memory to a huge number (I used 200Mb)
-(f) make all; it will fail on toplev.cc due to a problem with src/oct-conf.h
-(g) Fix src/oct-conf.h and make all again.
-(g) make install
-
-Here are the details for the above items:
-(a) Be sure that libncurses is in the Tenon Application Library in
-    the Extensions folder:
-
-    (i) use resedit.  
-    (ii) Open the libncurses file in folder:
-          Extensions/Tenon Applications Library/disabled
-    (iii) Open the cfrag resource.  Scroll down a bit and you will find the 
-        string libcurses.  Change it to libncurses. Save.
-    (iv) Change (File Menu/File Information) the file creator to MUMM. Save.
-    (v) now move libncurses out of the disabled folder to 
-          Extensions/Tenon Applications Library
-    (vi) Reboot.  
-
-(b) Replace the MT /usr/bin/sed with gnu sed (I used 2-0.5).  
-    This fixes a problem with the kpathsea/klibtool script.
-
-(c) Login as root and apply the following patch to /usr/include/sys/signal.h:

-(d) For increased speed in compiling and decreased disk space requirements,

-        LDFLAGS=`echo ${LDFLAGS} | sed '1,$s/-g//'`
-      ;;
-
-    Also remove -g from: 
-      LDFLAGS in readline/examples/Makefile.in
-
-(e) Run configure (use the --prefix flag if desired)
-
-(f) (cd src ; make oct-conf.h)
-
-(g) Fix src/oct-conf.h
-
-    You'll need to change the line

-    edit oct-conf.h results in a compilation error in toplev.cc.
-
-(h) make all
-
-    Be prepared to wait quite awhile.  Most of the time is spent waiting
-    for individual ar commands to build the libraries.

+Octave now sends data over the same pipe that is used to send commands

 Snapshots are an "image" of the main Octave development tree, captured
 at a particular random instant in time.  When you use the snapshots,
 you should be able to maintain a local copy of Octave that is
 reasonably close to the official source tree used by the Octave
 maintainers.
 
 The primary purpose of providing snapshots is to widen the group of
 motivated developers that would like to help test, debug, and enhance
