  ** Real, integer and logical matrices, when used in indexing, will now
     cache the internal index_vector value (zero-based indices) when
     successfully used as indices, eliminating the conversion penalty for
     subsequent indexing by the same matrix. In particular, this means it is
     no longer needed to avoid repeated indexing by logical arrays using
     `find' for performance reasons.
 
-** The built-in function equivalents to associative operators (plus, times,
-   mtimes, and, or) have been extended to accept multiple arguments. This is
-   especially useful for summing (multiplying, etc.) lists of objects

+
+ ** The default behavior of assert (observed, expected) has been relaxed
+    to employ less strict checking that does not require the internals
+    of the values to match. This avoids previously valid tests from
+    breaking due to new internal classes introduced in future Octave
+    versions.
+
+    For instance, all of these assertions were true in Octave 3.0.x
+    but false in 3.2.x due to new optimizations and improvements:
+
+      assert (2*linspace (1, 5, 5), 2*(1:5))
+      assert (zeros (0, 0), [])
+      assert (2*ones (1, 5), (2) (ones (1,5)))
