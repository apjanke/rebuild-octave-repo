 standards of co-locating the real/imag parts in memory.  Also due to the
 way @sc{Matlab} allows access to the arrays passed through a pointer,
 the MEX interface might require copies of arrays (even non complex
 ones).
 
 @item Block comments
 Block comments denoted by "%@{" and "%@}" markers are supported by
 Octave with some limitations. The major limitation is that block
-comments are not supported with [] or {}.
+comments are not supported with [] or @{@}.
 
 @item Mat-File format
 There are some differences in the mat v5 file format accepted by
 Octave. @sc{Matlab} recently introduced the "-V7.3" save option which is
 an HDF5 format which is particularly useful for 64-bit platforms where
 the standard matlab format can not correctly save variables.. Octave
 accepts HDF5 files, but is not yet compatible with the "-v7.3" versions
 produced by @sc{Matlab}.
