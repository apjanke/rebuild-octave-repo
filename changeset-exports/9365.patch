 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.3:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
  ** The `lookup' function was extended to be more useful for general-purpose
     binary searching. Using this improvement, the ismember function was
-    rewritten for significantly better performance.
+    rewritten for significantly better performance. The underlying algorithm
+    of lookup was also improved and is now much faster in certain important 
+    cases. 
 
  ** Real, integer and logical matrices, when used in indexing, will now
     cache the internal index_vector value (zero-based indices) when
     successfully used as indices, eliminating the conversion penalty for
     subsequent indexing by the same matrix. In particular, this means it is
     no longer needed to avoid repeated indexing by logical arrays using
     `find' for performance reasons.
