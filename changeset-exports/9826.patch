    a simple variable reference.
 
  ** The effect of comparison operators (<,>,<=,>=) when applied to complex numbers 
     has changed to be consistent with the strict ordering defined by max, min and sort.
     More specifically, complex numbers are compared by lexicographical comparison of
     the pairs [abs(z), arg(z)]. Previously, only real parts were compared; this can be
     trivially achieved by wrapping the operands in real().
 
+ ** The automatic simplification of complex computation results has changed. Octave will
+    now simplify any complex number with a zero imaginary part or any complex matrix
+    with all elements having zero imaginary part to a real value. Previously, this was done
+    only for positive zeros.
+    Note that the behavior of the `complex' function is unchanged and it still
+    produces a complex value even if the imaginary part is zero.
+
  ** As a side effect of code refactoring in liboctave, the binary logical operations
     are now more easily amenable to compiler optimizations and are thus significantly
     faster.
 
  ** Octave now allows user-defined subsasgn methods to optimize out redundant copies.
     For more information, see the manual.
 
  ** More efficient matrix division handling. Octave is now able to handle the expressions
