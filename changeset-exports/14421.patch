 A permutation matrix can also be returned from the built-in functions
 @dfn{lu} and @dfn{qr}, if a pivoted factorization is requested.
 
 The @dfn{sparse} function will convert a permutation matrix efficiently to a
 sparse matrix.
 The @dfn{find} function will also work efficiently with a permutation matrix,
 making it possible to conveniently obtain the permutation indices.

 The following can be used to solve a linear system @code{A*x = b}
 using the pivoted LU@tie{}factorization:
 
 @example
