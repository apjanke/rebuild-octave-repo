+## Return a new matrix formed by extracting the lower (@code{tril})
 ## or upper (@code{triu}) triangular part of the matrix @var{a}, and
 ## setting all other elements to zero.  The second argument is optional,
 ## and specifies how many diagonals above or below the main diagonal should
 ## also be set to zero.
 ##
 ## The default value of @var{k} is zero, so that @code{triu} and
 ## @code{tril} normally include the main diagonal as part of the result
 ## matrix.
