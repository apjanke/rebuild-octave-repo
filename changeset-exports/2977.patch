 Summary of changes since version 2.0.5:
 --------------------------------------
 
+  * Octave's expression parser is more general and consistent.  It is
+    now possible to access structure elements and index arbitrary
+    values.  For example, expressions like
+
+      my_home_dir = getpwuid (getuid ()) . dir;
+
+    and
+
+      svd (x) (1:5)
+
+    now work.
+
   * New built-in variable `print_rhs_assign_val' controls what is
     printed when an assignment expression is evaluated.  If it is
     zero, the value of the variable on the left hand side (after the
     assignment) is printed.  Nonzero, the value of the right hand side
     (i.e., the result of the expression) is printed.  The default
     value of is zero, so the behavior is the same as in previous
     versions of Octave.
