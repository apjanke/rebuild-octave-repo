     cause Octave to abort execution of a MEX file and return to the
     prompt if an error is encountered in mexCallMATLAB.
 
  ** The MEX API now includes the function mexCallMATLABWithTrap.  This
     function will not abort if an error occurs during mexCallMATLAB, but
     instead will return execution to the MEX function for error
     handling.
 
+ ** The functions mxAssert and mxAssertS for checking assertions have
+    been added.  In order to avoid a performance penalty they are only
+    compiled in to debug versions of a MEX file, i.e., that are produced
+    when the '-g' option is given to mex() or mkoctfile().
+
  ** Other new MEX API functions include mexEvalStringWithTrap.
 
  ** Other new functions added in 4.2:
 
       audioformats
       camlight
       condeig
       deg2rad
