Calculate cov as Matlab does, not as its conjugate (bug #48315).

* NEWS: Announce change.

* cov.m: Remove "conj" from calculation of output.  Update compatibility note
to explain what Matlab actually does.

 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 4.2:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
- ** condest now works with a normest1 compatible syntax.
-
  ** The parser has been extended to accept, but ignore, underscore
     characters in numbers.  This facilitates writing more legible code
     by using '_' as a thousands separator or to group nibbles into bytes
     in hex constants.
 
     Examples: 1_000_000 == 1e6 or 0xDE_AD_BE_EF

  ** The graphics command "hold on" now ensures that each new plot added to
     an existing plot has a different color or linestyle according to the
     "ColorOrder" and/or "LineStyleOrder" properties.  This is equivalent
     to the old command "hold all" and was made for Matlab compatibility.
     Existing code *may* produce differently colored plots if it did not
     specify the color for a plot and relied on each new plot having the

  ** When starting, Octave now looks in the function path for a file
     startup.m and executes any commands found there.  This change was
     made to accommodate Matlab users.  Octave has it's own configuration
     system based on the file .octaverc which is preferred.
 
  ** Octal ('\NNN') and hex ('\xNN') escape sequences in single quoted
     strings are now interpreted by the function do_string_escapes().

  ** mkfifo now interprets the MODE argument as an octal, not decimal,
     integer.  This is consistent with the equivalent shell command.
 
  ** linspace now returns an empty matrix if the number of requested
     points is 0 or a negative number.  This change was made to be
     compatible with Matlab releases newer than 2011.  In addition,
     Octave no longer supports matrix inputs for A or B.
 
+ ** The cov function now returns the complex conjugate of the result

  ** The griddata function no longer plots the interpolated mesh if no
     output argument is requested, instead the vector or array of
     interpolated values is always returned for Matlab compatibility.
 
  ** The new function "light" and corresponding graphics object provide
     light and shadow effects for patch and surface objects.
 
  ** The surfnorm function now returns unnormalized (magnitude != 1)
