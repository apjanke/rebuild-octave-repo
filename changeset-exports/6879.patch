 Octave uses the GNU readline library to handle reading and editing
 input.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to the
 cursor movement commands used by GNU Emacs, and a vi-style line
 editing interface is also available.  At the end of each session, the
 command history is saved, so that commands entered during previous
 sessions are not lost.

 Up to Octave 2.9.9 there was no support for graphic handles in Octave
 itself. There is in Octave 2.9.10 and later, and so the graphics between
 Octave and @sc{Matlab} are currently in the process of converging to a
 common interface.  Note that the basic graphic handle stuff is in place

 @item Simulink
 
 Octave itself includes no Simulink support. Typically the simulink
 models lag research and are less flexible, so shouldn't really be used
 in a research environment. However, some @sc{Matlab} users that try to use
 Octave complain about this lack. There is a similar package to simulink
 for the Octave and R projects available at @url{http://www.scicraft.org/}
 
 @item Mex-Files
 
 Octave includes an API to the matlab MEX interface. However, as MEX is
 an API to the internals of @sc{Matlab} and the internals of Octave differ to
 @sc{Matlab}, there is necessarily a manipulation of the data to convert from
 a MEX interface to the Octave equivalent. This is notable for all
 complex matrices, where matlab stores complex arrays as real and
-imaginary parts, whereas octave respects the C99/C++ standards of
-co-locating the real/imag parts in memory. Also due to the way matlab
+imaginary parts, whereas Octave respects the C99/C++ standards of
+co-locating the real/imag parts in memory. Also due to the way @sc{Matlab}
 allows access to the arrays passed through a pointer, the MEX interface
 might require that copies of arrays (even non complex ones). There were
 some serious memory leaks in the MEX API in Octave up to version 2.9.9,
 and version 2.9.10 or later should be used if posible.

 Indexing can be applied to all objects in Octave and not just

 @code{y = sin(x); y = y([1:10]);}
