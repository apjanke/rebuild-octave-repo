Update appdata.xml to follow conventions (bug #49952).

* etc/icons/octave.appdata.xml.in: Use "metadata_license" rather than
deprecated "licence".  Add "program_license" entry.  Use "component" rather
than deprecated "application" entry.  Update URL for screenshot.  Update
copyright on appdata.xml file itself to include 2017.  Use "image" tag
within <screenshot> entry for conformance with standard.

     <p>
       GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for
       numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical
       solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other
       numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities
       for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through
       its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write

       problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating ordinary
       functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary
       differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily
       extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in
       Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in
       C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
