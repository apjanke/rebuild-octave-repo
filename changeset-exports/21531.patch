 Any parameter whose name contains the name of a type (e.g.,
 @var{integer} or @var{matrix}) is expected to be of that
 type.  Parameters named @var{object} may be of any type.  Parameters
 with other sorts of names (e.g., @var{new_file}) are discussed
 specifically in the description of the function.  In some sections,
 features common to parameters of several functions are described at the
 beginning.
