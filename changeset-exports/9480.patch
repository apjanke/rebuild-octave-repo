  ** Real, integer and logical matrices, when used in indexing, will now
     cache the internal index_vector value (zero-based indices) when
     successfully used as indices, eliminating the conversion penalty for
     subsequent indexing by the same matrix. In particular, this means it is
     no longer needed to avoid repeated indexing by logical arrays using
     `find' for performance reasons.
 
+ ** sub2ind and ind2sub were reimplemented as compiled functions for better
+    performance. These functions are now faster, can deliver more economized
+    results for ranges, and can reuse the index cache mechanism described in
+    previous paragraph.
+
  ** The built-in function equivalents to associative operators (plus, times,
     mtimes, and, or) have been extended to accept multiple arguments. This
     is especially useful for summing (multiplying, etc.) lists of objects
     (of possibly distinct types):
    
       matrix_sum = plus (matrix_list{:});
 
  ** The default behavior of assert (observed, expected) has been relaxed
