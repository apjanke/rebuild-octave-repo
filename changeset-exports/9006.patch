  ** Improved performance for reduction operations.
 
     The performance of the sum, prod, sumsq, cumsum, cumprod, any, all,
     max and min functions has been significantly improved.
 
+ ** Sorting and searching.
+    
+    The performance of sort has been improved, especially when sorting
+    indices are requested. An efficient built-in issorted implementation
+    was added. sortrows now uses a more efficient algorithm, especially
+    in the homegeneous case. lookup is now a built-in function performing
+    a binary search, optimized for long runs of close elements. Lookup
+    also works with cell arrays of strings.
+
+ ** Range arithmetics
+
+    For some operations on ranges, Octave will attempt to keep the result as a
+    range.  These include negation, adding a scalar, subtracting a scalar, and
+    multiplying by a scalar. Ranges with zero increment are allowed and can be
+    constructed using the built-in function `ones'.
+
+ ** Various performance improvements.
+
+    Performance of a number of other built-in operations and functions was
+    improved, including:
+
+    * logical operations
+    * comparison operators
+    * element-wise power
+    * accumarray
+    * cellfun

  ** 64-bit integer arithmetic.
 
     Arithmetic with 64-bit integers (int64 and uint64 types) is fully
     supported, with saturation semantics like the other integer types.
     Performance of most integer arithmetic operations has been
     improved by using integer arithmetic directly.  Previously, Octave
     performed integer math with saturation semantics by converting the
     operands to double precision, performing the operation, and then

  ** Changes to strcat.
 
     The strcat function is now compatible with Matlab's strcat
     function, which removes trailing whitespace when concatenating
     character strings.  For example
 
       strcat ('foo ', 'bar')
