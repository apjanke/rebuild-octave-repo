+## Given two vectors of x-y data, @code{bar} produces a horizontal bar graph.
+##
+## If only one argument is given, it is taken as a vector of y-values
+## and the x coordinates are taken to be the indices of the elements.

+## If @var{y} is a matrix, then each column of @var{y} is taken to be a
+## separate bar graph plotted on the same graph. By default the columns
+## are plotted side-by-side. This behavior can be changed by the @var{style}
+## argument, which can take the values 'group' (the default), or 'stack'.

+## If two output arguments are specified, the data are generated but
