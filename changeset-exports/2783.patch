-Version 2.0.4 fixes some problems with the configure scripts and
-Makefiles that were present in 2.0.3.  It will probably be the last
-2.0.x release unless some serious new bugs are found and reported.
+Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed
+and this will probably be the last in the series of 2.0.x releases
+unless some serious new bugs are found and reported.
 
-There are also two new features (what would be the fun of making a
-release just to fix bugs? :-) both of which are kluges to allow a bit
-more compatibility with Matlab:
+There are two new features:
 
-  * It is now possible to use commands like ls, save, and cd as simple
-    variable names.  They still cannot be used as formal parameters
-    for functions, or as the names of structure variables.  Failed
-    assignments leave them undefined (you can recover the orginal
-    function definition using clear).
+  * A `switch' statement is now available for compatibility with
+    MATLAB 5.  See the Statements chapter in the manual for details.
 
-  * Is is now possible to invoke commands like ls, save, and cd as
-    normal functions (for example, load ("foo", "x", "y", "z")).
+  * Commands like ls, save, and cd may now also be used as formal
+    parameters for functions.
 
-You can help make Octave more reliable by reporting any bugs you find
+Version 2.0.5 also includes about 1400 tests (up from about 560) but
+more are needed.  If you would like to help improve Octave by writing

 Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
