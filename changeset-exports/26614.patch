 Algorithm Notes: The @sc{lapack} library provides two routines for calculating
 the full singular value decomposition (left and right singular matrices as
 well as singular values).  When calculating just the singular values the
 following discussion is not relevant.

+The default routine used by Octave is the newer @code{gesdd} which is based on
+a Divide-and-Conquer algorithm that is 5X faster than the alternative
 @code{gesvd}, which is based on QR factorization.  However, the new algorithm
 can use significantly more memory.  For an @nospell{MxN} input matrix the
 memory usage is of order O(min(M,N) ^ 2), whereas the alternative is of order
 O(max(M,N)).  In general, modern computers have abundant memory so Octave has
 chosen to prioritize speed.
 
 In addition, there have been instances in the past where some input matrices
 were not accurately decomposed by @code{gesdd}.  This appears to have been
