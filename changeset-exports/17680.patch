 @section How to Contribute
-The mailing list for Octave development discussion and sending
-contributions is @email{maintainers@@octave.org}.  This concerns the
-development of Octave core, i.e., code that goes to Octave directly.
-You may consider developing and publishing a package instead; a great
-place for this is the allied Octave-Forge project
-(@url{http://octave.sourceforge.net}).  Note that the Octave core project is
-inherently more conservative and follows narrower rules.

 @section Building the Development Sources
 
 The directions for building from the Development sources change from
 time to time, so you should read the resources for developers on the web
 or in the development sources archive.  Start here:
