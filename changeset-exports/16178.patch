New function citation() to display citation information (patch #7960)

* display_info_file.m: the new function is pretty much the same as news() so
  this new private function is their common code
* citation.m: the new function
* help.m: changed to use the private function with common code with citation()
* CITATION: new file with citation instructions for Octave core
* Makefile.am: add CITATION file into the build system and install into octetc
* bootstrap.conf: make sure that the CITATION is present when installing
* copy_files.m: make pkg() check and install CITATION files from packages
* doc/interpreter/package.txi: document optional CITATION files for packages
