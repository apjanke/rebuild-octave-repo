 An array with @samp{nd} dimensions can be indexed by a vector @var{idx} which
 has from 1 to @samp{nd} elements.  If any element of @var{idx} is not a
 scalar then the complete set of index tuples will be generated from the
 Cartesian product of the index elements.
 
 For the ordinary and most common case, the number of indices
 (@code{nidx = numel (@var{idx})}) matches the number of dimensions @samp{nd}.

 @w{@code{nidx < nd}} but one of the indices @code{@var{idx}(i)} is outside the
 size of the current array, then the last @w{@code{nd - nidx + 1}} dimensions
 are folded into a single dimension with an extent equal to the product of
 extents of the original dimensions.  This is easiest to understand with an
 example.

 undefined if the input arguments are not integers, or if one of the arguments

 The interpreter property can take three values: @qcode{"none"}, @qcode{"tex"},

 rendering occurs---the displayed text is a verbatim copy of the specified text.
