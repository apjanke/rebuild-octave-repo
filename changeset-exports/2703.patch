 Please understand, however, that there is only a limited amount of time

 Also, binary distributions are limited to static binaries that do not
 support dynamic linking.  For earlier versions of Octave, I tried
 distributing dynamically linked binaries but that proved to be too much
 trouble to support.  If you want to have a copy of Octave that includes
 all the features described in this manual, you will have to build it
 from the sources yourself, or find someone else who is willing to do it
 for you.

 Command descriptions have a format similar to function descriptions,
