     Matrix division is similarly affected. 
 
  ** More efficient handling of triangular matrix factors returned from factorizations.
     The functions for computing QR, LU and Cholesky factorizations will now automatically
     return the triangular matrix factors with proper internal matrix_type set, so that it
     won't need to be computed when the matrix is used for division.
 
+ ** The built-in "sum" function now handles the non-native summation (i.e. double precision
+    sum of single or integer inputs) more efficiently, avoiding a temporary conversion of
+    the whole input array to doubles. Further, "sum" can now accept an "extra" option argument,
+    using a compensated summation algorithm rather than a straightforward sum, which significantly
+    improves precision if lots of cancellation occurs in the summation.
 
 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.2:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
  ** Compatibility with Matlab graphics has been improved.
 
     The hggroup object and associated listener callback functions have
     been added allowing the inclusion of group objects.  Data sources
