+    bar-series, etc objects for better Matlab compatibility.
 
  ** Experimental OpenGL/FLTK based backend to replace gnuplot
 
     An experimental backend to replace the gnuplot backend has been
     written based on FLTK. This backend is off by default. You can
     switch to using this  with the command
 
         backend ("fltk")
 
     for all future figures or for a particular figure with the command
 
         backend (h, "fltk")
 
     where "h" is a valid figure handle.

  ** Eliminate the functions for direct access to gnuplot from Octave.
     The functions __gnuplot_plot__, __gnuplot_set__, __gnuplot_raw__,
      __gnuplot_show__, __gnuplot_replot__, __gnuplot_splot__,
      __gnuplot_save_data__  and __gnuplot_send_inline_data__ have been
     removed from Octave. These function were incompatible with the high
     level graphics handle code.
 
  ** The fsolve function now accepts an option structure argument (see
     also the optimset function).
     The INFO values returned from fsolve have changed to be compatible
     with Matlab's fsolve function.
 
  ** Object Oriented Programming
 
-    TO BE WRITTEN
+    Octave now includes OOP features and the user can create their 
+    own class objects and overloaded functions and operators. For
+    example, all methods of a class called "myclass" will be found in 
+    a directory "@myclass" on the users path. The class specific versions
+    of functions and operators take precedence over the generic versions
+    of these functions. See the Octave manual for more details.
 
  ** Block comments
     Commented code can be between matching "%{" and "%}" markers, even
     if the commented code spans several line. This allows blocks code
     to be commented, without needing to comment each line. For
     example, 
 
     function y = func (x)
