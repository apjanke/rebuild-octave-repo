doc/doxyhtml/Doxyfile.in: Update comments, enable grouping and HTML timestamps.

No big changes happened here.  The comments of Doxyfile.in are now in sync
with the Doxywizard of version 1.8.11 (30-12-2015), that is quite helpful for
decisions.  Some new options are introduced, some of them are default values,
so they were introduced unnocticed and are now explicitly stated:

- MARKDOWN_SUPPORT       = YES
- AUTOLINK_SUPPORT       = YES
- DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC   = YES (default: NO)
- EXTRACT_PACKAGE        = NO
- INLINE_INFO            = YES
- INPUT_ENCODING         = UTF-8
- HTML_TIMESTAMP         = YES (default: NO)

+# is 0..9, the default is 0, corresponding to a cache size of 2^16=65536
