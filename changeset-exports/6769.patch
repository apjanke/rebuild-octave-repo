-Graphical User Interface:
-------------------------
-
-  * In an X11 or other windowing environment, allow the user to pop up
-    windows for menus and other purposes.  A good place to start might
-    be Tk, as long as Tcl is avoided.

-  * Add a way to handle events, like alarms, mouse clicks, etc.

 Input/Output:
 ------------
 
   * Make fread and fwrite work for complex data.  Iostreams based
     versions of these functions would also be nice, and if you are
     working on them, it would be good to support other size
     specifications (integer*2, etc.).
