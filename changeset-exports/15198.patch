+  libinterp     -- The interpreter itself plus lots of infrastructure
                    around it.  Octave's extensive octave_value class
                    hierarchy for polymorphically handling all Octave
                    types is defined here.  The built-in functions are
-                   also defined here, so if "help foo" tells you foo is
-                   built-in, its source will be somewhere in this
-                   directory.
-    DLD-FUNCTIONS  * Dynamically linked oct files.  If you see "help foo"
-                     telling you that foo is defined in foo.oct, then
-                     foo.cc will be found here and contain the source
-                     code.
-    OPERATORS      * Definitions and template instantiations for
+                   also defined here.
+
+    octave-value     the octave_value class hierarchy.  These are the
+                     container classes that hold various Octave data
+                     types like struct numerical arrays, structure
+                     arrays, and cell arrays.
+
+    parse-tree       Classes that define the parse tree for the
+                     interpreter.
+
+    interp-core      Core utilities for the interpreter.  There are no
+                     DEFUN functions (callable from the scripting
+                     language) defined here.
+
+    interpfcn        Functions closely related to the interpreter.
+                     Includes DEFUN functions (callable from the
+                     scripting language).  Also may export C++ functions
+                     that are used in other parts of the interpreter.
+
+    corefcn          Statically linked DEFUN functions (callable from
+                     the scripting langauge).  No C++ functions exported
+                     for use in other parts of the interpreter.
+
+    dldfcn           Dynamically linked DEFUN functions (callable
+                     from the scripting language).  If you see "help
+                     foo" telling you that foo is defined in foo.oct,
+                     then foo.cc will be found here and contain the
+                     source code.
+
+    operators        Definitions and template instantiations for
                      operators for all possible Octave type
                      combinations.
