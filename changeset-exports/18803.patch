 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 4.2:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
+ ** A new syntax for object oriented programming termed classdef has been
+    introduced.  See the manual for more extensive documentation of the
+    classdef interface.
+    
+    New keywords:
+
+      classdef      endclassdef
+      enumeration   endenumeration
+      events        endevents
+      methods       endmethods

  ** Interpolation function changes for Matlab compatibility
 
     The interpolation method 'cubic' is now equivalent to 'pchip'
     for interp1, interp2, and interp3.  Previously, 'cubic' was equivalent
     to 'spline' for interp2.  This may produce different results as 'spline'
     has continuous 1st and 2nd derivatives while 'pchip' only has a continuous
     1st derivative.

       * round(x) != x or the value is outside the range allowed by the
         integer format specifier.
 
     There is still one difference:  Matlab switches to '%e' and Octave
     is currently switching to '%g'.
 
+ ** Z-order stacking issues with patches, grid lines, and line object
+    plot markers for on screen display and printing have all been resolved.
+    For 2-D plots the axis grid lines can be placed on top of the plot
+    with set (gca, "layer", "top").
+
+ ** The patch graphic object has been overhauled.  It now produces visual
+    results equivalent to Matlab even for esoteric combinations of
+    faces/vertices/cdata.
+
+ ** The polar() plot function now draws a circular theta axis and 
+    radial rho axis rather than using a rectangular x/y axis.
+
  ** linkprop has been completely re-coded for performance and Matlab
     compatibility.  It now returns a linkprop object which must be stored
     in a variable for as long as the graphic objects should remain linked.
     To unlink properties use 'clear hlink' where hlink is the variable
     containing the linkprop object.
