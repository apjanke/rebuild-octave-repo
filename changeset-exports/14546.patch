 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.8:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
+ ** Octave now supports nested functions with scoping rules that are
+    compatible with Matlab.  A nested function is one declared and defined
+    within the body of another function.  The nested function is only
+    accessible from within the enclosing function which makes it one
+    method for making private functions whose names do not conflict with those
+    in the global namespace (See also subfunctions and private functions).
+    In addition, variables in the enclosing function are visible within the
+    nested function.  This makes it possible to have a pseudo-global variable
+    which can be seen by a group of functions, but which is not visible in
+    the global namespace.
+    
+    Example:
+    function outerfunc (...)
+      ...
+      function nested1 (...)
+        ...
+        function nested2 (...)
+           ...
+        endfunction
+      endfunction
+
+      function nested3 (...)
+        ...
+      endfunction
+    endfunction
+
  ** 'emptymatch', 'noemptymatch' options added to regular expressions.
 
     With this addition Octave now accepts the entire set of Matlab options
     for regular expressions.  'noemptymatch' is the default, but 'emptymatch'
     has certain uses where you need to match an assertion rather than actual
     characters.  For example, 
 
     regexprep ('World', '^', 'Hello ', 'emptymatch')
       => Hello World
 
     where the pattern is actually the assertion '^' or start-of-line.
 
  ** For compatibility with Matlab, the regexp, regexpi, and regexprep
     functions now process backslash escapes in single-quoted pattern
-    strings.  The regexprep function now processes backslash escapes in
-    single-quoted replacement strings.

+    strings.  In addition, the regexprep function now processes backslash
+    escapes in single-quoted replacement strings.
 
  ** Redundant terminal comma accepted by parser
 
     A redundant terminal comma is now accepted in matrix
     definitions which allows writing code such as 
 
     [a,...
      b,...
