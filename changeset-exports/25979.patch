 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 5.0 (yyyy-mm-dd):
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  ** The determination of an object's dimensions, size, and shape by the
     functions ndims, rows, columns, isscalar, isvector, isrow, iscolumn,
-    ismatrix, and issquare now fully depends on the function size.  Thus
-    any user-defined object can ensure correct treatment by the aforementioned
-    functions by properly overloading the "size" function.

+    function.
 
  ** The functions issymmetric and ishermitian accept an option "nonskew"
     or "skew" to calculate the symmetric or skew-symmetric property
     of a matrix.  Performance has also been increased.
 
  ** The issorted function now uses a direction option of "ascend" or
     "descend" to make it compatible with both the sort function and
     with Matlab.  Change all uses of "ascending" and "descending" in

  ** Figure graphic objects have a new property "Number" which is
     read-only and will return the handle (number) of the figure.
     However, if the property "IntegerHandle" has been set to "off" then
     the property will return an empty matrix ([]).

  ** Printing using the -dtiff output device will now create compressed
     images using lzw compression.  This change was made for Matlab
     compatibility.  To produce uncompressed images use the -dtiffn
     device.

  ** The OSMesa library is no longer used.  To print invisible figures
     when using OpenGL graphics, the Qt QOFFSCREENSURFACE feature must be
     available and you must use the qt graphics toolkit.

       ordeig

  ** Legacy functions.
 
     The following functions have been declared legacy functions which
     means they are obsolete and should not be used in any new code.
     Unlike deprecated functions, however, their removal from Octave has
     not yet been scheduled.
