     (2) By default, Matlab treats consecutive delimiters are as a single
     delimiter.  By default, Octave's legacy behavior was to return an
     empty string for the part between the delmiters.
 
-    Where the legacy behavior is desired, the call to strsplit() should
-    specify that the delimitertype is "legacy".
-
-    strsplit (str, del, "collapsedelimiters", false,
-      "delimitertype", "legacy")
+    Where the legacy behavior is desired, the call to strsplit() may be
+    replaced by ostrsplit(), which is Octave's original implementation of
+    strsplit().
 
  ** Octave now supports nested functions with scoping rules that are
     compatible with Matlab.  A nested function is one declared and defined
     within the body of another function.  The nested function is only
     accessible from within the enclosing function which makes it one
     method for making private functions whose names do not conflict with those
     in the global namespace (See also subfunctions and private functions).
     In addition, variables in the enclosing function are visible within the
