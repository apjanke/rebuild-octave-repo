 numerical computations that is mostly compatible with

+@sc{Matlab}.@footnote{@sc{Matlab} is a registered trademark of The
+MathWorks, Inc.}
 
 Octave can do arithmetic for real, complex or integer-valued scalars
 and matrices, solve sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, integrate
 functions over finite and infinite intervals, and integrate systems of
 ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations.
 
 Octave uses the GNU readline library to handle reading and editing
 input.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to the
 cursor movement commands used by GNU Emacs, and a vi-style line
 editing interface is also available.  At the end of each session, the
 command history is saved, so that commands entered during previous
 sessions are not lost.

 @item Just-In-Time compiler
 @sc{Matlab} includes a "Just-In-Time" compiler. This compiler allows the
 acceleration of for-loops in @sc{Matlab} to almost native performance with
 certain restrictions. The JIT must know the return type of all functions
 called in the loops and so you can't include user functions in the loop
 of JIT optimized loops.  Octave doesn't have a JIT and so to some might
 seem slower than @sc{Matlab}.  For this reason you must vectorize your code as
 much as possible.  The MathWorks themselves have a good document
 discussing vectorization at

 @noindent
 It shows that unlike in Octave, mldivide in @sc{Matlab} is not invariant
 with respect to column permutations. If there are multiple columns of
 the same norm, permuting columns of the matrix gets you different
 result than permuting the solution vector. This will surprise many
 users.

+Since the mldivide (\) and mrdivide (/) operators are often part of a more
+complex expression, where there is no room to react to warnings or flags, it
 should prefer intelligence (robustness) to speed, and so the Octave developers
 are firmly of the opinion that Octave's approach for singular, under- and
 over-determined matrices is a better choice that @sc{Matlab}'s

 The extensions in Octave over @sc{Matlab} syntax are
 very useful, but might cause issues when sharing with @sc{Matlab} users.
