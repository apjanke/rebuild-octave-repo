 What is Octave?
 ---------------
 
 Octave is a high-level interactive language, primarily intended for
 numerical computations that is mostly compatible with Matlab.
 
 Octave can do arithmetic for real and complex scalars and matrices,

 The Octave distribution includes a 200+ page Texinfo manual.  Access
 to the complete text of the manual is available via the help command
 at the Octave prompt.
 
 Two and three dimensional plotting is fully supported using gnuplot.
 
 The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones

+like Lapack, Odepack, Dassl, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
 of C++ classes.  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
 with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
 functions.  If that's not possible, you can still compile Octave if
 you have the free Fortran to C translator f2c.
 
 Octave is also free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
 under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
 Free Software Foundation.
 
-Instructions for obtaining Octave are given below.
-
-Where to get Octave
--------------------
-
-If you are on the Internet, you can copy the latest distribution
-version of Octave from the file /pub/octave/octave-M.N.tar.gz, on the
-host ftp.che.wisc.edu.  This tar file has been compressed with GNU
-gzip, so be sure to use binary mode for the transfer.  M and N stand
-for version numbers; look at a listing of the directory through ftp to
-see what version is available.  After you unpack the distribution, be
-sure to look at the files README and INSTALL.
-
-Installation
-------------
-
-Octave requires approximately 50MB of disk storage to unpack and
-install (significantly less if you don't compile with debugging
-symbols).  In order to build Octave, you will need a current version
-of g++, libg++, and GNU make.  If you don't have these tools, you can
-get them from many anonymous ftp archives, including ftp.che.wisc.edu,
-ftp.uu.net, prep.ai.mit.edu, and wuarchive.wustl.edu, or by writing to
-the FSF at 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.
-
-Octave has been compiled and tested with g++ and libg++ on a
-SPARCstation 2 running SunOS 4.1.2, an IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3.2.5,
-DEC Alpha systems running OSF/1 1.3 and 3.0, a DECstation 5000/240
-running Ultrix 4.2a, and i486 systems running Linux.  It should work
-on most other Unix systems that have a working port of g++ and libg++.
-
-Implementation
---------------
-
-Octave is being developed with GNU make, bison (a replacement for
-YACC), flex (a replacement for lex), gcc/g++, and libg++ on Sun
-SPARCstations, DEC DECstations, and IBM RS/6000s. It should be
-easy to port it to any machine that has a working port of gcc/g++.
-
-The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
-like Lapack, Linpack, Odepack, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
-of C++ classes (see the files in the libcruft and liboctave
-subdirectories).  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
-with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
-functions.  If that's not possible, they are translated with f2c and
-compiled with a C compiler.  Better performance is usually achieved if
-the intermediate translation to C is avoided.
-
-The library of C++ classes may also be useful by itself, and they are
-distributed under the same terms as Octave.

-Bugs

-
-Please report any problems you have to

-  bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu
-
-Your bug reports play an essential role in making Octave reliable.
-
-Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
-or it may not.  In any case, the principal function of a bug report
-is to help the entire community by making the next version of Octave
-work better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of
-Octave.
-
-The file BUGS in the top level directory of the source distribution
-contains more information about how to provide useful bug reports.
-
-Comments and suggestions are also always welcome.

 This directory contains the source for Octave, a high-level interactive
 language for solving numerical problems.  See the files README.octave
 and Announce for more general information, and the file NEWS for a
 list of recent changes.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
-PLEASE NOTE:  We are only distributing gzipped files because we no

 Binary distributions:
 --------------------
 
 Binaries for several popular systems are distributed along with the
 source, and are available in the following subdirectories of
 /pub/octave/BINARIES:
 
   subdirectory            binary compiled on
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   alpha-dec-osf1.3        DEC Alpha/OSF1

   sparc-sun-sunos4.1.2    Sun SPARC running SunOS 4.1.2
 
 Note:
 
+  * Binary distributions for Octave 2.0 will be available when there
+    is time to create them.  We depend on volunteers to make binaries
+    for most systems.  If you would like to help out, please contact
+    bug-octavebevo.che.wisc.edu.
+
   * Gnuplot binaries are *not* included.  For the plotting commands to
     work, you will need to install gnuplot on your system.  See the
     file INSTALL.octave in the top level directory of the distribution
     for more details.
 
   * Octave has been compiled assuming that you have `less' installed.
     You can use the environment variable PAGER to choose another pager.
 
   * We only have a limited amount of time available to devote to
     making binaries, so binaries may not be immediately available
     for some platforms.  Please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu if
     you are interested in helping make binary distributions available.
 
-A note about patches:
---------------------
-
-If you are trying to compile Octave with g++ 2.7.x, you should get the
-file README-GCC-2.7.0.
-
-The patch in the file libg++-procbuf-bug fixes a serious problem in
-libg++ that can cause Octave to crash when trying to execute commands
-like `ls', or display output through the pager.
-
-The patch in the file libg++-complex-div-bug fixes a problem in libg++
-that can cause division of real numbers by complex numbers to overflow
-unnecessarily.
-
 A note about .gz files:
 ----------------------
 
 Files with names ending in `.gz' have been compressed with `gzip'.
 
 Unlike the compress utility, gzip is free of any known software
 patents and tends to compress better anyway.  Gzip can uncompress
 `compress'-compressed files too, so you can install it as "uncompress"
