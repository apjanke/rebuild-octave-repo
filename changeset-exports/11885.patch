 @section Representing Images
 
 In general Octave supports four different kinds of images, gray-scale
 images, RGB images, binary images, and indexed images. A gray-scale
 image is represented with an M-by-N matrix in which each
 element corresponds to the intensity of a pixel. An RGB image is

+represented with an M-by-N-by-3 array where each
 3-vector corresponds to the red, green, and blue intensities of each
 pixel.
 
 The actual meaning of the value of a pixel in a gray-scale or RGB
 image depends on the class of the matrix. If the matrix is of class
 @code{double} pixel intensities are between 0 and 1, if it is of class
 @code{uint8} intensities are between 0 and 255, and if it is of class
 @code{uint16} intensities are between 0 and 65535.
