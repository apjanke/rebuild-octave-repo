  ** The behavior of library functions `ismatrix', `issquare', and
     `issymmetric' has been changed for better consistency.
     
-    * The `ismatrix' function now returns true for all numeric and
-      logical 2d or Nd matrices.  Previously, `ismatrix' returned false
-      if the first or second dimension was zero.  Hence, `ismatrix ([])'

     * The `issquare' function now returns a logical scalar, and is

       The dimension is no longer returned.  As a result, `issquare ([])'
       now yields true.
