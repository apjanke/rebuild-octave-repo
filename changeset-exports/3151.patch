 Subject: ANNOUNCE: Octave Version 2.0.9 released
 
-Octave version 2.0.9 is now available for ftp from ftp.che.wisc.edu
-in the directory /pub/octave.  Diffs from the previous release are
-also available in the same directory.
+Octave version 2.0.10 is now available for ftp from ftp.che.wisc.edu
+in the directory /pub/octave.  Diffs from the previous have not been
+made because they would be quite large.

 Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed.
 
-This is a bug-fixing release, but there is one new user-visible
-feature:
+This is mostly a bug-fixing release, but to keep things interesting,
+there are some new features:
+
+  * The built-in variable `PWD' has been removed.  If you need to get
+    the value of the current working directory, use the pwd() function
+    instead.
+
+  * For compatibility with Matlab, Octave's lyap function now solves
+
+      A*X + X*A' + C = 0
+
+    instead of
+
+      A'*X + X*A + C = 0
+
+    To try to avoid confusion for people who are used to the way
+    Octave behaved in previous versions, a warning is printed the
+    first time lyap is called in a given session.  To completely
+    disable the warning, simply add
+
+      global __disable_lyap_interface_change_warning__;
+
+    to your ~/.octaverc file.  The warning will eventually disappear
+    for good in some future version of Octave.
+
+  * New built-in functions for computing Bessel functions:
+    besseli, besselj, besselk, and bessely.
+
+  * The gammai and betai functions are now implemented as built-in
+    functions rather than function files.
+
+  * The new built-in variable `implicit_num_to_str_ok' controls
+    whether Octave converts expressions like `[97, 98, 99, "123"]' to
+    strings.  The default value is 0 unless you use --traditional.
+
+  * The new built-in variable `fixed_point_format' controls whether
+    Octave uses a scaled fixed-point format for displaying matrices.
+    The default value is 0 unless you use --traditional.
 
-  * It is now possible to specify a label for lines in the plot key
-    when using the plot function.  For example,
+  * The function sumsq now computes sum (x .* conj (x)) for complex values.
+
+  * Dynamically linked functions can be cleared.
+
+  * If a .oct file has a time stamp more recent than the time that it
+    was loaded, it is automatically reloaded.  Reloading a .oct file
+    may cause several functions to be cleared automatically.  By
+    default, a warning is printed that lists the names of the
+    functions that will be cleared.  You can suppress the message by
+    setting the new built-in variable `warn_reload_forces_clear' to 0.
+
+  * Global variables are now initialized to the empty matrix, for
+    compatibility with Matlab.
+
+  * Explicit initialization of global variables only happens once.
+    For example, after the following statements are evaluated, g still
+    has the value 1.
 
-      plot (x, y, "-*;sin(x);")
+      global g = 1
+      global g = 2
+
+    This is useful for initializing global variables that are used to
+    maintain state information that is shared among several functions.
+
+  * The new built-in variable max_recursion_depth allows you to
+    prevent Octave from attempting infinite recursion.  The default
+    value is 256.
 
-    plots y vs. x using the linespoints style and sets the title of
-    the line in the key to be `sin(x)'.
+  * Octave now uses readline version 2.1 and kpathsea 3.0.
+
+  * The libreadline and libkpathsea libraries are no longer installed.
+
+  * The libcruft, liboctave, and liboctinterp libraries are now
+    installed in $libdir/octave instead of just $libdir.
+
+  * It's no longer necessary to have libg++, but you do need to have
+    the GNU implementation of libstdc++.  If you are using gcc 2.7.2,
+    libstdc++ is distributed as part of libg++ 2.7.2.  For later
+    versions, libstdc++ is distributed separately.  For egcs,
+    libstdc++ is included with the compiler distribution.
 
 Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
 numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.

 If you can, you should probably install Octave from one of the binary
 distributions available from ftp.che.wisc.edu, or using one of the
 Debian or RPM packages that are available at other sites.  For
 example, Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org> maintains the Debian
 Octave package and usually has them ready within a day or so of new
 Octave releases.  They are available via the WWW at

 If for some reason you can't (or choose not to) install Octave from
 one of the binary distributions or by using one of the Debian or RPM
 packages and something goes wrong, please check the following list to
 see if your problem is already well known before reporting a bug.
