+## @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{area} =} rectint (@var{a}, @var{b})
+##
+## Compute the area of intersection of rectangles in @var{a} and
+## rectangles in @var{b}.  Rectangles are defined as [x y width height]
+## where x and y are the minimum values of the two orthogonal
+## dimensions.
+##
+## If @var{a} or @var{b} are matrices, then the output, @var{area}, is a
+## matrix where the ith row corresponds to the ith row of a and the jth
+## column corresponds to the jth row of b.
