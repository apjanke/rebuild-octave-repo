   ## We are limiting ourselves to this set of characters because the
   ## version will appear on the filepath.  The portable character, according to
   ## http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_278
   ## is [A-Za-z0-9\.\_\-].  However, this is very limited.  We specially
   ## want to support a "+" so we can support "pkgname-2.1.0+" during
   ## development.  So we use Debian's character set for version strings
   ## https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version
   ## with the exception of ":" (colon) because that's the PATH separator.
