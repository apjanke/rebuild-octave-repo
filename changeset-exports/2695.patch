 Subject: ANNOUNCE: Octave Version 2.0.2 released
 
-Octave version 2.0.2 is now available for ftp from ftp.che.wisc.edu
+Octave version 2.0.3 is now available for ftp from ftp.che.wisc.edu
 in the directory /pub/octave.  Diffs from the previous release are
 also available in the same directory.

 In addition to the source distributions, there are binary
 distributions available for Linux running on Intel systems and OSF/1
 running on Alpha systems.  Binary distributions for other platforms
 will be available from ftp.che.wisc.edu when they are contributed by
 volunteers.  If you would like to help to make a binary distribution
 available, please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

+Version 2.0.3 is primarily a bug-fixing release.  Most bugs reported
+since the release of version 2.0.2 have been fixed.  There are also a
 few new features, including:
 
-  * Octave now stops executing commands from a script file if an error
-    is encountered.
+  * The manual has been completely revised and now corresponds much
+    more closely to the features of the current version.
+
+  * The return value for assignment expressions is now the RHS since
+    that is more consistent with the way other programming languages
+    work.  However, Octave still prints the entire LHS value so that
+
+      x = zeros (1, 2);
+      x(2) = 1
+
+    still prints
 
-  * The return, and break commands now cause Octave to quit executing
-    commands from script files.  When used in invalid contexts, the
-    break, continue, and return commands are now simply ignored
-    instead of producing parse errors.
+      x =
+
+        0  1
+
+    but an assignment like
 
-  * size ("") is now [0, 0].
+      z = x(2) = 1
+
+    sets z to 1 (not [ 0, 1 ] as in previous versions of Octave).
 
-  * New functions:
+  * It is now much easier to make binary distributions.  See the
+    Binary Distributions section of the manual for more details.
 
-      sleep   -- pause execution for a specified number of seconds
-      usleep  -- pause execution for a specified number of microseconds
 
 You can help make Octave more reliable by reporting any bugs you find
 to bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
 
 Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
 numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with Matlab.
