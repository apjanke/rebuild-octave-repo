     In addition two new error functions erfi (imaginary error function) and
     dawson (scaled imaginary error function) have been added.
 
  ** The glpk function has been modified to reflect changes in the GLPK
     library.  The "round" and "itcnt" options have been removed.  The
     "relax" option has been replaced by the "rtest" option.  The numeric
     values of error codes and of some options have also changed.
 
+ ** The kurtosis function has changed definition to be compatible with 
+    Matlab.  It now returns the base kurtosis instead of the "excess kurtosis".
+    The old behavior can be had by changing scripts to normalize with -3.

  ** The default name of the Octave crash dump file is now 
     "octave-workspace" instead of "octave-core".
 
  ** A citation command has been added to display information on how to
     cite Octave and packages in publications.  The package system will
     look for and install CITATION files from packages.

 ## Display a matrix as an indexed color image.
 ##
 ## The elements of @var{img} are indices into the current colormap.
 ## @var{x} and @var{y} are optional 2-element vectors, @w{@code{[min, max]}},
 ## which specify the range for the axis labels.  If a range is specified as
 ## @w{@code{[max, min]}} then the image will be reversed along that axis.  For
 ## convenience, @var{x} and @var{y} may be specified as N-element vectors
 ## matching the length of the data in @var{img}.  However, only the first and
 ## last elements will be used to determine the axis limits.
 ## @strong{Warning:} @var{x} and @var{y} are ignored when using gnuplot 4.0
 ## or earlier.
 ##
+## Multiple property/value pairs may be specified for the image object, but
+## they must appear in pairs.
+##
 ## The optional return value @var{h} is a graphics handle to the image.
 ##
 ## Implementation Note: The origin (0, 0) for images is located in the
 ## upper left.  For ordinary plots, the origin is located in the lower
 ## left.  Octave handles this inversion by plotting the data normally,
 ## and then reversing the direction of the y-axis by setting the
 ## @code{ydir} property to @qcode{"reverse"}.  This has implications whenever
 ## an image and an ordinary plot need to be overlaid.  The recommended
 ## solution is to display the image and then plot the reversed ydata
 ## using, for example, @code{flipud (ydata)}.
 ##
+## Calling Forms: The @code{image} function can be called in two forms:
+## High-Level and Low-Level.  When invoked with normal options, the High-Level
+## form is used which first calls @code{newplot} to prepare the graphic figure
+## and axes.  When the only inputs to @code{image} are property/value pairs
+## the Low-Level form is used which creates a new instance of an image object
+## and inserts it in the current axes.

-## Run scripts in the current workspace that are not necessarily on the

+## Scripts which reside in directories specified in Octave's load
+## path, and which end with the extension @file{".m"}, can be run simply by
+## typing their name.  For scripts not located on the load path, use @code{run}.
+##
+## The file name @var{script} can be a bare, fully qualified, or relative

+## The bias-corrected kurtosis coefficient is obtained by replacing the sample

+## If @var{x} is a matrix, or more generally a multi-dimensional array, return

 ## @var{dim} argument is given, operate along this dimension.

-## Note: The definition of kurtosis above yields a kurtosis of zero for the
-## stdnormal distribution and is sometimes referred to as "excess kurtosis".
-## To calculate kurtosis without the normalization factor of @math{-3} use
