  ** The built-in "bsxfun" function now uses optimized code for certain cases where built-in
     operator handles are passed in. Namely, the optimizations concern the operators
     plus, minus, times, ldivide, rdivide, power, and, or (for logical arrays), the relational
     operators eq, ne, lt, le, gt, ge, and the functions min and max.
     Optimizations only apply when both operands are of the same built-in class. Mixed real/complex
     and single/double operations will first convert both operands to a common type.
 
+ ** "strfind" and "strrep" now have compiled implementations, facilitating significantly 
+    more efficient searching and replacing in strings, especially with longer patterns.
