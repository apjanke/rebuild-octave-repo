     + It is no longer possible to mix Matlab-style plot commands with
       the old (and now considered obsolete) style of plot commands
       (__gnuplot_set__, etc.).  You can do one or the other, but not
       both for the same plot.
 
     + Plot property values are not extensively checked.  Specifying
       invalid property values may produce unpredictible results.
 
+    + Octave no longer creates temporary data files for plotting, but
+      instead sends data over the same pipe that is used to send
+      commands to gnuplot.  While this avoids the problem of
+      cluttering /tmp with data files, it is no longer possible to use
+      the mouse to zoom in on plots.  This is a limitation of gnuplot,
+      which is unable to zoom when the data it plots is not stored in
+      a file.
 
  ** The way Octave handles search paths has changed.  Instead of
     setting the built-in variable LOADPATH, you must use addpath,
     rmpath, or path to manipulate the function search path.  These
     functions will maintain "." at the head of the path, for
     compatibility with Matlab.
 
     Leading, trailing or doubled colons are no longer special.
