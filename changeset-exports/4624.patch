 This directory contains the source for Octave, a high-level interactive
 language for solving numerical problems.  See the files README.octave
 and Announce for more general information, and the file NEWS for a
 list of recent changes.
 
 Binary distributions:
 --------------------
 
 Octave binaries are no longer distributed from this site.
 
 Packaged versions of Octave for various GNU/Linux systems are available
 with the major GNU/Linux distributions (Debian, Red Hat, SuSE, etc.).
 
-Tom Weichmann <tomcw@localnet.com> and Julian A. de Marchi
-<julian@matlinks.net> have created a package that makes 
-Octave easier to install on Windows systems.  You can find a pointer
-to it on the download page of the Octave web site, www.octave.org.
+Binary distributions of Octave for Mac OS X are available as part of
+the fink project: http://fink.sourceforge.net
+
+The file README.Windows provides instructions for installing Octave on
+Windows systems.
 
 A note about .gz files:
 ----------------------
 
 Files with names ending in `.gz' have been compressed with `gzip'.
 
 Unlike the compress utility, gzip is free of any known software
 patents and tends to compress better anyway.  Gzip can uncompress
