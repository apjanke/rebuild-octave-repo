  ** The effect of comparison operators (<,>,<=,>=) when applied to complex numbers 
     has changed to be consistent with the strict ordering defined by max, min and sort.
     More specifically, complex numbers are compared by lexicographical comparison of
     the pairs [abs(z), arg(z)]. Previously, only real parts were compared; this can be
     trivially achieved by wrapping the operands in real().
