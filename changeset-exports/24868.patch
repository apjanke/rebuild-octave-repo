 ## The "API version" is used as a way of checking that interfaces in the
 ## liboctave and libinterp libraries haven't changed in a backwardly
 ## incompatible way when loading .oct files.  A better way to do that is

 ## NOTE: This macro will be removed in a future version of Octave.  If
 ## you insist on checking for features using a version number, use the
 ## OCTAVE_MAJOR_VERSION, OCTAVE_MINOR_VERSION, and
