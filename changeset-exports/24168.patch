Undo markdown usage for README (cset 312c00dd723a).

Automake requires a file explicitly called "README", see for details:
https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Gnits.html

* README: Rename from README.md.

* Makefile.am (README): Remove dummy rule.
(EXTRA_DIST): Update list.

* bootstrap.conf: Check for README, not README.md.

+GNU Octave -- a high-level language for numerical computations
+==============================================================
+
+Copyright (C) 1996-2017 John W. Eaton
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended
+for numerical computations.  It provides capabilities for the
+numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for
+performing other numerical experiments.  It also provides extensive
+graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.  GNU
+Octave is normally used through its interactive interface (CLI and
+GUI), but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs.
+The GNU Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most
+programs are easily portable.
+
+GNU Octave is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
+under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or
+(at your option) any later version.
+
+GNU Octave is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
+WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+along with Octave; see the file COPYING.  If not, see
+<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
+
+Availability
+------------
+
+The latest released version of Octave is always available from
+<https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/octave/> and many mirror sites around the
+world.  You may also find links to binary distributions at
+<https://www.octave.org/download.html>.  The current development
+sources may be found under the Source Code tab on
+[Savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/octave/).
+
+Installation
+------------
+
+Octave requires approximately 1.4 GB of disk storage to unpack and
+compile from source (significantly less, 400 MB, if you don't compile
+with debugging symbols).  Once installed, Octave requires
+approximately 350 MB of disk space (again, considerably less, 70 MB,
+if you don't build shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do
+not include debugging symbols).
+
+To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of:
+
+- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
+- [GNU G++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or another C++11 compiler
+- [GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), another Fortran 77
+  compiler, or [f2c](http://www.netlib.org/f2c/)
+
+Octave's Makefiles use features of GNU Make that are not present in
+other versions of make.  If you use `f2c`, you will need a script
+like `fort77` that works like a normal Fortran compiler by combining
+`f2c` with your C compiler in a single script.
+
+See the notes in the files `INSTALL.OCTAVE` and the system-specific
+`README` files in the `etc` directory of the Octave source
+distribution for more detailed installation instructions.
+
+Bugs and Patches
+----------------
+
+The file `BUGS` explains the recommended procedure for reporting bugs
+on the [bug tracker](http://bugs.octave.org) or contributing patches.
+
+Documentation
+-------------
+
+* [Octave's manual](https://www.octave.org/doc/interpreter/) is a
+  comprehensive user guide covering introductive and more advanced
+  topics.
+* [Octave's wiki](https://wiki.octave.org) is a user community page,
+  covering various topics and answering
+  [FAQ](https://wiki.octave.org/FAQ).
+* [Octave's Doxygen](https://www.octave.org/doxygen/) documentation
+  explains the C++ class libraries.
+
+Partially, the up-to-dateness of the documentation is lagging a bit
+behind the development of the software.  If you notice omissions or
+inconsistencies, please report them at our bug tracker.  Specific
+suggestions for ways to improve Octave and its documentation are
+always welcome.  Reports with patches are even more welcome.
