 Octave's manual has been revised for version 2.0, but it is lagging a
 bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is

 Octave is being developed with the Free Software Foundation's make,

 If Octave prints things like `%.-1e' instead of numbers when you use a
 dynamically linked .oct file, you probably need to create shared
 versions of the Octave libraries.  To do that, configure Octave with

 Also, binary distributions are limited to static binaries that do not
 support dynamic linking.  For earlier versions of Octave, I tried
 distributing dynamically linked binaries but that proved to be too much
 trouble to support.  If you want to have a copy of Octave that includes
 all the features described in the manual, you will have to build it
 from the sources yourself, or find someone else who is willing to do it
