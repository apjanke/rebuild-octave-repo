 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 6 (yyyy-mm-dd):
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
- ** The interpreter now supports handles to nested functions which was a
-    long-standing incompatibility with Matlab.
-
- ** The graphics backend has seen many small improvements.
+### General improvements
 
-    * Graphic primitives now accept a color property value of "none"
-      which is useful when a particular primitive needs to be hidden
-      (for example, the Y-axis of an axes object with "ycolor" = "none")
-      without hiding the entire primitive ("visibility" = "off").
-
-    * "LineWidth" and "MarkerSize" properties are now measured in
-      points, *not* pixels.  This change was made for Matlab
-      compatibility.  Compared to previous versions of Octave, some
-      lines and markers will appear 4/3 larger.
+- The `edit` function option `"editinplace"` now defaults to `true`.
+  Files will no longer be copied to the user's HOME directory for
+  editing and then copied back to their original location.
 
-    * The appearance of patterned lines (LineStyle = ":"|"--"|"-.") has
-      been improved for small widths (LineWidth < 1.5 pixels) which is a
-      common scenario.
+#### Graphics backend
 
- ** Printing to EPS files now uses a tight bounding box ("-tight"
-    argument to print) by default.  This makes more sense for EPS
-    files which are normally embedded within other documents, and is
-    Matlab compatible.  If necessary use the "-loose" option to
-    reproduce figures as they appeared in previous versions of Octave.
-
- ** The edit function option "editinplace" now defaults to true.  Files
-    will no longer be copied to the user's HOME directory for editing
-    and then copied back to their original location.
-
- ** New functions added in Octave 6:
+- Graphic primitives now accept a color property value of `"none"`
+  which is useful when a particular primitive needs to be hidden
+  (for example, the Y-axis of an axes object with `"ycolor" = "none"`)
+  without hiding the entire primitive `"visibility" = "off"`.
 
-      lightangle
-      verLessThan
-
- ** Deprecated functions.
-
-    The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 6 and will
-    be removed from Octave 8 (or whatever version is the second major
-    release after 6):
-
-      Function               | Replacement
-      -----------------------|------------------
-      output_max_field_width | output_precision
-
- ** The following functions were deprecated in Octave 4.4 and have been
-    removed from Octave 6.
+- The appearance of patterned lines `"LineStyle" = ":"|"--"|"-."` has
+  been improved for small widths (`"LineWidth"` less than 1.5 pixels)
+  which is a common scenario.
 
-      Function             | Replacement
-      ---------------------|------------------

- ** Deprecated graphics properties.
+### Matlab compatibility

+- The interpreter now supports handles to nested functions.
