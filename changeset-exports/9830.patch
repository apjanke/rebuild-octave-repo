  ** The built-in "sum" function now handles the non-native summation (i.e. double precision
     sum of single or integer inputs) more efficiently, avoiding a temporary conversion of
     the whole input array to doubles. Further, "sum" can now accept an "extra" option argument,
     using a compensated summation algorithm rather than a straightforward sum, which significantly
     improves precision if lots of cancellation occurs in the summation.
 
  ** The built-in "bsxfun" function now uses optimized code for certain cases where built-in
     operator handles are passed in. Namely, the optimizations concern the operators
-    plus, minus, times, ldivide, rdivide, and, or (for logical arrays), the relational
