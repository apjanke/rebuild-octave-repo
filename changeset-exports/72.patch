 function [aa, bb, q, z] = qzhess (a, b)
 
+# Usage: [aa, bb, q, z] = qzhess (a, b)
+#
 # Compute the qz decomposition of the matrix pencil (a - lambda b)
 #
 # result: (for Matlab compatibility):
 #
 #   aa = q*a*z and bb = q*b*z, with q, z orthogonal, and
 #   v = matrix of generalized eigenvectors.
 #
 # This ought to be done in a compiled program
 #
 # Algorithm taken from Golub and Van Loan, Matrix Computations, 2nd ed.
