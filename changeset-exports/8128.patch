 A large number of the @sc{Matlab} core functions (ie those that are in
 the core and not a toolbox) are implemented, and certainly all of the

 example code and would need lots of work to complete it.
 
 @item Graphic Handles
 Up to Octave 2.9.9 there was no support for graphic handles in Octave
-itself.  There is in Octave 2.9.10 and later, and so the graphics between
-Octave and @sc{Matlab} are currently in the process of converging to a

 @item GUI 
 There are no @sc{Matlab} compatible GUI functions.  There are a number of
 bindings from Octave to Tcl/Tk, Vtk and zenity included in the
 Octave Forge project (@url{http://octave.sourceforge.net}) for example
 that can be used for a GUI, but these are not @sc{Matlab}

 differ from @sc{Matlab}, there is necessarily a manipulation of the data
 to convert from a MEX interface to the Octave equivalent. This is
 notable for all complex matrices, where @sc{Matlab} stores complex
 arrays as real and imaginary parts, whereas Octave respects the C99/C++
 standards of co-locating the real/imag parts in memory.  Also due to the
 way @sc{Matlab} allows access to the arrays passed through a pointer,
 the MEX interface might require copies of arrays (even non complex

+Block comments denoted by "%@{" and "%@}" markers are supported by
+Octave with some limitations. The major limitation is that block
+comments are not supported with [] or {}.
 
 @item Mat-File format
 There are some differences in the mat v5 file format accepted by
 Octave. @sc{Matlab} recently introduced the "-V7.3" save option which is
 an HDF5 format which is particularly useful for 64-bit platforms where
 the standard matlab format can not correctly save variables.. Octave
 accepts HDF5 files, but is not yet compatible with the "-v7.3" versions
 produced by @sc{Matlab}. 
 
-Up to version 2.9.10, Octave can't load/save the inline or function
-handles saved in mat-files by @sc{Matlab} (though can in its own
-format). In 2.9.11 and later Octave can load inline and function handles
-saved in the mat-file formats, but can't save them to mat-files.
+Although Octave can load inline abd function handles saved by
+@sc{Matlab}, it can not yet save them.
 
 Finally, Some multi-byte unicode characters aren't yet treated in
 mat-files.
 
 @item Profiler
 Octave doesn't have a profiler. Though there is a patch for a flat
 profiler, that might become a real profiler sometime in the future. see
