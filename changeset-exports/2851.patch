     by 1, and false value by 0.  Comparison operations like <, <=, ==,
     >, >=, and != now return logical values.  Indexing operations that
     use zero-one style indexing must now use logical values.  You can
     use the new function logical() to convert a numeric value to a
     logical value.  This avoids the need for the built-in variable
     prefer_zero_one_indexing, so it has been removed.  Logical values
     are automatically converted to numeric values where appropriate.
 
+  * If the argument to lsode that names the user-supplied function is
+    a 2-element string array, the second element is taken as the name
+    of the Jacobian function.  The named function should have the
+    following form:
+
+      JAC = f (X, T)
+
+    where JAC is the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of the
+    right-hand-side functions that define the set of differential
+    equations with respect to the state vector X.

 Summary of changes for version 2.0.5:
 ------------------------------------
 
   * A `switch' statement is now available.  See the Statements chapter
     in the manual for details.
 
   * Commands like ls, save, and cd may now also be used as formal
     parameters for functions.
