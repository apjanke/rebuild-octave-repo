   * The set and show commands for setting and displaying gnuplot
     parameters have been replaced by gset and gshow.  This change will
     probably break lots of things, but it is necessary to allow for
     compatibility with the Matlab graphics and GUI commands in a
     future version of Octave.  (For now, the old set and show commands
     do work, but they print an annoying warning message to try to get
     people to switch to using gset.)
 
+  * Octave has been mostly ported to Windows NT and Windows 95 using
+    the beta 17 release of the Cygnus GNU-WIN32 tools.  Not everything
+    works, but it is usable.  See the file README.WINDOWS for more
+    information.

   * Dynamic linking works on more systems using dlopen() and friends
     (most modern Unix systems) or shl_load() and friends (HP/UX
     systems).  A simple example is provided in examples/hello.cc.
     For this feature to work, you must configure Octave with
     --enable-shared.  You may also need to have a shared-library
     version of libg++ and libstdc++.
 
   * New data types can be added to Octave by writing a C++ class.  On

+Octave has been mostly ported to Windows NT and Windows 95 using the
+beta 17 release of the Cygnus GNU-WIN32 tools.  Not everything works,
+but it is usable.  If you would like to volunteer to work on
+improving this port, please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
+
+Here is a list of current problems (and workarounds, where available).
+
+* There is no binary version of Octave available for Windows NT or
+  Windows 95.  One will probably be released when the port is a little
+  more stable.
+
+* To compile and install Octave on a Windows NT or Windows 95 system,
+  you will need to get the beta 17 release of the GNU-WIN32 tools.  They
+  are available from ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32.
+
+* There is a conflict between the files /cygnus/include/g++/String.h and
+  /cygnus/H-i386-cygwin32/i386-cygwin32/include/stringh.  You should
+  rename or remove /cygnus/include/g++/String.h.  (These file names
+  assume that you have installed the GNU-WIN32 tools in /cygnus).
+
+* On Windows 95 systems, there is a bug that causes redirections to
+  /dev/null to fail.  You can work around the problem by substituting
+  /dev/nul for /dev/null in all of the files that use it.
+
+* You will need to have f2c and libf2c.a or g77 installed.  You can get
+  a copy of f2c from ftp://netlib.att.com/netlib/f2c.
+
+* You will also need a termcap library.  The GNU termcap library seems
+  to work.  You can get it from any GNU archive site, including 
+  ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/termcap-1.3.tar.gz.
+
+* GNU info doesn't work yet.  It compiles but doesn't run.  Perhaps the
+  problem is just that a proper termcap entry needs to be defined.
+
+* If you have a working version of less, the pager will probably work.
+  The GNU-WIN32 tools used to include a copy of less, but I am told it
+  was dropped from the distribution because it didn't work very well.
+
+* To make plotting work, you will need to find a version of gnuplot
+  that can read commands from a pipe.  The binary versions of gnuplot
+  for Windows that I found could only read from their command windows,
+  and wouldn't accept commands through a pipe, so they could not be
+  called from Octave.
+
+  After deleting -DREADLINE from the Makefile, I was able to compile a
+  working version of gnuplot 3.6 beta 315 using the GNU-WIN32 tools,
+  but it does not support the Windows graphics terminal.  It does
+  support dumb terminals and lots of other output devices, including
+  PostScript, but it would be much nicer if it could open a separate
+  window and draw pretty graphs there.
+
+
+If you know of solutions for any of these problems, please contact
+bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
+
+More information about the GNU-WIN32 project is available via the WWW
+at http://www.cygnus.com/gnu-win32.
