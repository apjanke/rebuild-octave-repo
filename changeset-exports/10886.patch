  ** The `strfind' and `strrep' functions now have compiled
     implementations, facilitating significantly more efficient searching
     and replacing in strings, especially with longer patterns.  The code
     of `strcat' has been vectorized and is now much more efficient when
     many strings are concatenated.  The `strcmpi' and `strncmpi'
     functions are now built-in functions, providing better performance.
