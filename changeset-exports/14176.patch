 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.6:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
  ** The PCRE library is now required to build Octave.
 
+ ** The ARPACK library is no longer distributed with Octave.
+    If you need the eigs() or svds() functions you must provide an external
+    ARPACK through a package manager or by compiling it yourself.
+
  ** Many of Octave's binary operators (.*, .^, +, -, ...) now perform
     automatic broadcasting for array operations that allows you to use
     operator notation instead of calling bsxfun or expanding arrays (and
     unnecessarily wasting memory) with repmat or similar idioms.  For
     example, to scale the columns of a matrix by the elements of a row
     vector, you may now write
 
       rv .* M
