 	* optimization/__fdjac__.m: Fix setting up h.
 	* optimization/fsolve.m: Allow underdetermined systems. Use QR for
 	large enough square and overdetermined systems, with pivoting in the
 	first step. Simplify options. Adjust defaults - make TR radius
 	tolerance less stringent. Support DisplayFcn.
