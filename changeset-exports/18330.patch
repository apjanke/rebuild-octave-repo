 The expressions @code{D \ M} and @code{M / D} perform inverse scaling.
 They are equivalent to solving a diagonal (or rectangular diagonal)
 in a least-squares minimum-norm sense.  In exact arithmetic, this is
 equivalent to multiplying by a pseudoinverse.  The pseudoinverse of
 a rectangular diagonal matrix is again a rectangular diagonal matrix
 with swapped dimensions, where each nonzero diagonal element is replaced
 by its reciprocal.
 The matrix division algorithms do, in fact, use division rather than 
 multiplication by reciprocals for better numerical accuracy; otherwise, they
 honor the above definition.  Note that a diagonal matrix is never truncated due

 A "numerical zero" is a zero value occurring in a place where any floating-point
 value could occur.  It is normally stored somewhere in memory as an explicit
 value. 
 An "assumed zero", on the contrary, is a zero matrix element implied by the

 Octave includes a polymorphic solver, that selects an appropriate
 matrix factorization depending on the properties of the matrix itself. 
 Generally, the cost of determining the matrix type is small relative to 
 the cost of factorizing the matrix itself, but in any case the matrix 
 type is cached once it is calculated, so that it is not re-determined 
 each time it is used in a linear equation.

 Cholesky@tie{}factorization, performed above and by the @code{matrix_type}

 flag a non-Hermitian matrix.
