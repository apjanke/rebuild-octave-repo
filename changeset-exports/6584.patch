+@section Why GNU Octave?
 
-Octave was not developed by the FSF, but the FSF does distribute
-Octave, and the developers of Octave support the efforts of the FSF by
-encouraging users of Octave to order Octave on CD-ROM directly from
-the FSF.
+The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
+operating system which is free software: the GNU system.
+
+GNU is a recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not Unix''; it is pronounced
+guh-noo, approximately like canoe.
 
-The FSF is a nonprofit organization that distributes software and
-manuals to raise funds for more GNU development.  Buying a CD-ROM from
-the FSF contributes directly to paying staff to develop GNU software.
-CD-ROMs cost $240 if an organization is buying, or $60 if an individual
-is buying.
+The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is the principal organizational
+sponsor of the GNU Project.
+
+Octave became GNU Octave in 1997 (beginning with version 2.0.6).  This
+meant agreeing to consider Octave a part of the GNU Project and support
+the efforts of the FSF.  However, Octave is not and has never been
+developed by the FSF.
+
+For more information about the GNU project, see @url{www.gnu.org}.

 Octave includes the C-like increment and decrement operators @samp{++}

 @samp{+=}, @samp{-=}, @samp{*=}, @samp{/=}, @samp{^=}, @samp{.*=},
 @samp{./=}, and @samp{.^=}.
 
 For example, to pre-increment the variable @var{x}, you would write
 @code{++@var{x}}.  This would add one to @var{x} and then return the new
 value of @var{x} as the result of the expression.  It is exactly the
 same as the expression @code{@var{x} = @var{x} + 1}.
 
-To post-increment a variable @var{x}, you would write @code{@var{x}++}.
+To post-increment a variable @var{x}, you would write @code{x++}.
 This adds one to the variable @var{x}, but returns the value that
 @var{x} had prior to incrementing it.  For example, if @var{x} is equal
-to 2, the result of the expression @code{@var{x}++} is 2, and the new
+to 2, the result of the expression @code{x++} is 2, and the new

 Unknown differences.
 @end enumerate
 
 The first category, irrelevant differences, do not affect computations
 and most likely do not affect the execution of function files.
 
 The differences of the second category are usually because the authors
-of Octave decided on a better (subjective) implementation that the way
-@sc{Matlab} does it, and so introduced ``user preference variables'' so that
-you can customize Octave's behavior to be either @sc{Matlab}-compatible or
-to use Octave's new features.  To make Octave more @sc{Matlab}-compatible,
-put the following statements in your @file{~/.octaverc} file, or use the
-command line option @samp{--traditional}, which implies all of these
-settings.  Note that this list may not be complete, because some new
-variables may have been introduced since this document was last updated.

-@example
-@group
-  PS1                           = ">> "
-  PS2                           = ""
-  beep_on_error                 = true
-  crash_dumps_octave_core       = false
-  default_save_format           = "mat-binary"
-  fixed_point_format            = true
-  page_screen_output            = false
-  print_empty_dimensions        = false
-  warn_function_name_clash      = false

-@itemize @bullet
-@item
-The Octave plotting functions are mostly compatible with the ones from
-@sc{Matlab} 3.x, but not from @sc{Matlab} 4.x.

+of Octave decided on a better (subjective) implementation than the way

+2.9.N version, most of the things that the @samp{--traditional} option

 The third category of differences is (hopefully) shrinking.  If you find
 a difference between Octave behavior and @sc{Matlab}, then you should send a
 description of this difference (with code illustrating the difference,
-if possible) to bug@@octave.org.
