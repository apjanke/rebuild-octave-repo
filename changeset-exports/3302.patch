 ## Start a subprocess with two-way communication.  The name of the process
 ## is given by @var{command}, and @var{args} is an array of strings
 ## containing options for the command.  The file identifiers for the input
 ## and output streams of the subprocess are returned in @var{in} and
 ## @var{out}.  If execution of the command is successful, @var{pid}
 ## contains the process ID of the subprocess.  Otherwise, @var{pid} is
 ## @minus{}1.
