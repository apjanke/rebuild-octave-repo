 function saveaudio (name, X, ext, bit)
   
-# usage:  saveaudio (name, X, [, ext [, bit]])
-#
-# Saves a vector X of audio data in the file "name.ext".
-# The format of the audio file is determined by ext which has to be
-# written without an inital ".";  default value for ext is "lin". 
-#
-# Currently, the following audio formats are supported:
-# *) mu-law files with extension "mu", "au" or "snd"
-# *) linearly encoded files with extension "lin" or "raw"
-# If the data is saved linearly, the bit argument decides whether an
-# 8-bit (default) or a 16-bit format is used.
