  ** The graphics backend has seen many small improvements. 
     
     * Graphic primitives now accept a color property value of "none"
       which is useful when a particular primitive needs to be hidden
       (for example, the Y-axis of an axes object with "ycolor" = "none")
       without hiding the entire primitive ("visibility" = "off").
 
+    * "LineWidth" and "MarkerSize" properties are now measured in
+      points, *not* pixels.  This change was made for Matlab
+      compatibility.  Compared to previous versions of Octave, some
+      lines and markers will appear 4/3 larger.
+
     * The appearance of patterned lines (LineStyle = ":"|"--"|"-.") has
       been improved for small widths (LineWidth < 1.5 pixels) which is a
       common scenario.
 
  ** New functions added in Octave 6:
