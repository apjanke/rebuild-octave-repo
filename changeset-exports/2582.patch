 Overview
 --------
 
 Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
 computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
 solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

 subdirectories).  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
 with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
 functions.  If that's not possible, they are translated with f2c and
 compiled with a C compiler.  Better performance is usually achieved if
 the intermediate translation to C is avoided.
 
 The library of C++ classes may also be useful by itself.
