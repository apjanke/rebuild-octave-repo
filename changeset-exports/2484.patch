 Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
 computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
 solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

 The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
 like Lapack, Linpack, Odepack, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
 of C++ classes (see the files in the libcruft and liboctave
 subdirectories).  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
 with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
 functions.  If that's not possible, they are translated with f2c and
 compiled with a C compiler.  Better performance is usually achieved if
