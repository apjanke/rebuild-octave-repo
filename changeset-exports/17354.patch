 ## The bit depth of the image determines the
 ## class of the output: @qcode{"uint8"}, @qcode{"uint16"} or @qcode{"single"}
 ## for gray and color, and @qcode{"logical"} for black and white.
 ## Note that indexed images always return the indexes for a colormap,
 ## independent if @var{map} is a requested output.  To obtain the actual
 ## RGB image, use @code{ind2rgb}.  When more than one indexed image is being
 ## read, @var{map} is obtained from the first.  In some rare cases this

 ## See the Octave manual for more information in representing images.

 ## Some file formats, such as TIFF and GIF, are able to store multiple
 ## images in a single file.  @var{idx} can be a scalar or vector
 ## specifying the index of the images to read.  By default, Octave
 ## will only read the first page.
