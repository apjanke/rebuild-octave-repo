  ** The strncmp and strncmpi functions now return true if the two input
     strings match, even though the number of characters specified by N
     exceeds the string length.  This behavior more closely matches
     common sense and is Matlab compatible.  Example:
 
       Octave 5.0 : strncmp ("abc", "abc", 100) => true
       Previously : strncmp ("abc", "abc", 100) => false
 
+ ** The fsolve function has been tweaked to use larger step sizes when
+    calculating the Jacobian of a function with finite differences.
+    This leads to faster convergence.  The default solver options have
+    also changed to be Matlab compatible.  This *may* result in existing
+    code producing different results.

  ** Figure graphic objects have a new property "Number" which is
     read-only and will return the handle (number) of the figure.
     However, if the property "IntegerHandle" has been set to "off" then
     the property will return an empty matrix ([]).
 
  ** Printing using the -dtiff output device will now create compressed
     images using lzw compression.  This change was made for Matlab
     compatibility.  To produce uncompressed images use the -dtiffn
