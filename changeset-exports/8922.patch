 Overview
 --------
 
 GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
 computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
 solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

 To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You
 will also need a recent version of g++ or other ANSI C++ compiler.
 You will also need a Fortran 77 compiler or f2c.  If you use f2c, you
 will need a script like fort77 that works like a normal Fortran
 compiler by combining f2c with your C compiler in a single script.

 Documentation
 -------------
 
 Octave's manual has been revised for version 3.0, but it is lagging a
 bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is
 currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries.  If
 you notice ommissions or inconsistencies, please report them as bugs
