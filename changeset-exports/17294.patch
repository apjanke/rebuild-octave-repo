-    characters.  For example,

-    regexprep ('World', '^', 'Hello ', 'emptymatch')
-      => Hello World
-
-    where the pattern is actually the assertion '^' or start-of-line.

+    strings, a backslash followed by a newline character is still
+    recognized as a line continuation, but the backslash character must
+    be followed *immediately* by the newline character.  No whitespace or
+    end-of-line comment may appear between them.
 
- ** For compatibility with Matlab, the regexp, regexpi, and regexprep

  ** The m-files in the image directory have been overhauled.
 
     The principal benefit is that Octave will now no longer automatically
     convert images stored with integers to doubles.  Storing images as uint8
     or uint16 requires only 1/8 or 1/4 the memory of an image stored using
     doubles.  For certain operations, such as fft2, the image must still be
     converted to double in order to work.
 
     Other changes include fixes to the way indexed images are read from a
     colormap depending on the image class (integer images have a -1 offset to
     the colormap row number), and always returning the actual indexed image
     with imread instead of a RGB image if the colormap was not requested
     as output.
