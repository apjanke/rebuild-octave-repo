import.m: Add placeholder m-file for import functionality.

* NEWS: Announce that bareword "import" is recognized, but funcionality is
not yet implemented.

* scripts/path/import.m: New function.  Has documentation and BIST test, but
merely emits an error if used.

* scripts/path/module.mk: Add import.m to build system.

  ** A new container data type--containers.Map--is available.  Map is a
     key/value storage container (a.k.a, a hash) that efficiently allows
     storing and retrieving values by name, rather than by position which
     is how arrays work.
 
+ ** The bareword "import" is now recognized in scripts and functions.
+    However, the functionality to import functions and classes from
+    other namespaces into the local scope has not yet been implemented.
+    Attempting to use "import" will provoke an error message.
+
  ** hex2num and num2hex now work for integer and char types and num2hex
     may optionally return a cell array of strings instead of a character
     array.  If given a cell array of strings, hex2num now returns a
     numeric array of the same size as the input cell array.  Previously,
     hex2num would accept a cell array of strings of arbitrary dimension
     but would always return a column vector.
 
  ** The "names" option used in regular expressions now returns a struct
