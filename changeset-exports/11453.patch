 Availability
 ------------
 
 The latest released version of Octave is always available via
 anonymous ftp from ftp.gnu.org and its many mirror sites around the
 world.  You may also find links to binary distributions at
 http://www.octave.org/download.html.  The current development sources
-may be found on Savannah (http://savannah.gnu.org).

-Installation and Bugs

+Installation
+------------
 
-Octave requires approximately 1.5GB of disk storage to unpack and
-compile from source (significantly less if you don't compile with
-debugging symbols).  Once installed, Octave requires approximately
-450MB of disk space (again, considerably less if you don't build
-shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do not include

+Octave requires approximately 1.4 GB of disk storage to unpack and
+compile from source (significantly less, 400 MB, if you don't compile
+with debugging symbols).  Once installed, Octave requires
+approximately 350MB of disk space (again, considerably less, 70 MB,
+if you don't build shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do
+not include debugging symbols).
 
 To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You
 will also need a recent version of g++ or another ANSI C++ compiler.
 You will also need a Fortran 77 compiler or f2c.  If you use f2c, you
 will need a script like fort77 that works like a normal Fortran
 compiler by combining f2c with your C compiler in a single script.
 
 YOU MUST HAVE GNU MAKE TO COMPILE OCTAVE.  Octave's Makefiles use
 features of GNU Make that are not present in other versions of make.
 GNU Make is very portable and easy to install.
 
 See the notes in the files INSTALL and INSTALL.OCTAVE for more
 specific installation instructions, including directions for
 installing Octave from a binary distribution.
