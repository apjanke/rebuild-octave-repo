 bug tracker instead.}.
 Mercurial is the source code management system currently used to develop
 Octave.  Other forms of contributions (e.g., simple diff patches) are
 also acceptable, but they slow down the review process.  If you want to
 make more contributions, you should really get familiar with Mercurial.

 Since Octave is Free Software users are encouraged to share their
 programs amongst each other.  To aid this sharing Octave supports the
 installation of extra packages.  The `Octave-Forge' project is a
 community-maintained set of packages that can be downloaded and
 installed in Octave.  At the time of writing the `Octave-Forge' project
