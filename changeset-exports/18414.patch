Workaround for clear -classes and failures in 'make check' (bug #41269)
Rename classes in fcn-handle-derived-resolution so they don't conflict
with the same class names in ctor-vs-method.

* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/@fhdr_derived/fhdr_derived.m: Renamed from derived.m

* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/@fhdr_other/fhdr_other.m: renamed from other.m
* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/@fhdr_other/getsize_arrayfun.m: Moved from @other dir.
* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/@fhdr_other/getsize_cellfun.m: Moved from @other dir.
* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/@fhdr_other/getsize_loop.m: Moved from @other dir.

* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/@fhdr_parent/fhdr_parent.m: renamed from parent.m
* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/@fhdr_parent/numel.m: Moved from @parent dir.

* fcn-handle-derived-resolution/fcn-handle-derived-resolution.tst: Call newly renamed
files in %!tests.

* test/fcn-handle-derived-resolution/module.mk: Add renamed files to build system.

 %%  Test script for legacy OOP.

-%! clear -classes
+%% FIXME: Can't use 'clear -classes' because it also clears all functions in the
+%% namespace of test.m (bug #35881).  This is a problem only if Octave would
+%% re-use a class definition that was defined somewhere else.  Unfortunately,
+%% that is exactly the case when running 'make check' since the ctor-vs-method
+%% test also uses an @parent, @derived, and @other class.
+%% Until the bug is fixed, it suffices to make the class names unique so that
+%% there is no re-use.  Using the prefix fhdr (fcn-handle-derived-resolution)
+%% for this directory.
