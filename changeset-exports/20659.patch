 The expression @var{boolean1} is evaluated and converted to a scalar
 using the equivalent of the operation @code{all (@var{boolean1}(:))}.
 If it is false, the result of the overall expression is 0.  If it is

 is 1.  Otherwise, the result of the overall expression is 0.
 
 @strong{Warning:} there is one exception to the rule of evaluating
 @code{all (@var{boolean1}(:))}, which is when @code{boolean1} is the
 empty matrix.  The truth value of an empty matrix is always @code{false}
 so @code{[] && true} evaluates to @code{false} even though
 @code{all ([])} is @code{true}.

 The fact that both operands may not be evaluated before determining the
 overall truth value of the expression can be important.  For example, in
