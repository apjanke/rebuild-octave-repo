 The following arithmetic operators are available, and work on scalars
 and matrices.  The element-by-element operators and functions broadcast
 (@pxref{Broadcasting}).
 
 @table @asis
 @item @var{x} + @var{y}
 @opindex +
 Addition.  If both operands are matrices, the number of rows and columns
-must both agree.  If one operand is a scalar, its value is added to
-all the elements of the other operand.
+must both agree, or they must be broadcastable to the same shape.
 
 @item @var{x} .+ @var{y}
 @opindex .+
 Element by element addition.  This operator is equivalent to @code{+}.
 
 @item @var{x} - @var{y}
 @opindex -
 Subtraction.  If both operands are matrices, the number of rows and
-columns of both must agree.
+columns of both must agree, or they must be broadcastable to the same

 @item @var{x} .- @var{y}
 Element by element subtraction.  This operator is equivalent to @code{-}.

 @opindex *
-Matrix multiplication.  The number of columns of @var{x} must agree
-with the number of rows of @var{y}.
