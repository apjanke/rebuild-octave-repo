 Clearly, Octave is now much more than just another `courseware' package
 with limited utility beyond the classroom.  Although our initial goals
 were somewhat vague, we knew that we wanted to create something that
 would enable students to solve realistic problems, and that they could
 use for many things other than chemical reactor design problems.
-
-There are those who would say that we should be teaching the students
-Fortran instead, because that is the computer language of engineering,
-but every time we have tried that, the students have spent far too much
-time trying to figure out why their Fortran code crashes and not enough
-time learning about chemical engineering.  With Octave, most students
-pick up the basics quickly, and are using it confidently in just a few
-hours.

 Although it was originally intended to be used to teach reactor design,
 it has been used in several other undergraduate and graduate
 courses in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of
 Texas, and the math department at the University of Texas has been using
-it for teaching differential equations and linear algebra as well.  If
-you find it useful, please let us know.  We are always interested to
-find out how Octave is being used in other places.

 Virtually everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do with
-music, but it is actually the name of a former professor of mine who
-wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction engineering, and who was
-also well known for his ability to do quick `back of the envelope'
-calculations.  We hope that this software will make it possible for many
-people to do more ambitious computations just as easily.
