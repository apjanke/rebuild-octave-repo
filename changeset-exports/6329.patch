 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.0:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
+ ** Compatibility with Matlab graphics is much better now.  We now
+    have some graphics features that work like Matlab's Handle
+    Graphics (tm):
+
+    + You can make a subplot and then use the print function to
+      generate file with the plot.
+
+    + RGB line colors are supported if you use gnuplot 4.2.  Octave
+      can still use gnuplot 4.0, but there is no longer any way to set
+      line colors with it when using the Matlab-style plot functions.
+      Actually, there never was any way to do this reliably with older
+      versions of gnuplot (whether run from Octave or not) since it
+      only provided a limited set to choose from, and they were
+      terminal dependent, so choosing color 1 with the X11 terminal
+      would be different from color 1 with the PostScript terminal.
+
+    + You can control the width of lines using (for example):
+
+	line (x, y, "linewidth", 4, "color", [1, 0, 0.5]);
+
+      (this also shows the color feature).
+
+    + With gnuplot 4.2, image data is plotted with gnuplot and may be
+      combined with other 2-d plot data.
+
+    + Lines for contour plots are generated with an Octave function, so
+      contour plots are now 2-d plots instead of special 3-d plots, and
+      this allows you to plot additional 2-d data on top of a contour
+      plot.
+
+    + It is no longer possible to mix Matlab-style plot commands with
+      the old (and now considered obsolete) style of plot commands
+      (__gnuplot_set__, etc.).  You can do one or the other, but not
+      both for the same plot.
+
+    + Plot property values are not extensively checked.  Specifying
+      invalid property values may produce unpredictible results.
+
+
  ** The way Octave handles search paths has changed.  Instead of
     setting the built-in variable LOADPATH, you must use addpath,
     rmpath, or path to manipulate the function search path.  These
     functions will maintain "." at the head of the path, for
     compatibility with Matlab.
 
     Leading, trailing or doubled colons are no longer special.
     Now, all elements of the search path are explicitly included in
