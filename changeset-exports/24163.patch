doc: use tree view in Doxygen documentation and add README and etc/HACKING.

* doc/doxyhtml/Doxyfile.in: New pages README.md and etd/HACKING.md.  Further
new doxygen documnetation should go into doc/doxyhtml/pages for claity.  New
options for the tree view:
DISABLE_INDEX = YES (default: NO)
GENERATE_TREEVIEW = YES (default: NO)

* src/main.in.cc: Remove redundand Doxygen documentation.  Doxygen now uses
README, see below.

* README.md: Markdownify and review the content.  The content of README is now
displayed on the Doxygen start page.

* etc/HACKING.md: Markdownify and review the content.

Some ideas where presented on the mailing list, see:
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/octave-maintainers/2017-10/msg00124.html

 Overview
 --------
 
-GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
-computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
-solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.
+GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended
+for numerical computations.  It provides capabilities for the
+numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for
+performing other numerical experiments.  It also provides extensive
+graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation.  GNU
+Octave is normally used through its interactive interface (CLI and
+GUI), but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs.
+The GNU Octave language is quite similar to Matlab so that most
+programs are easily portable.

+sources may be found under the Source Code tab on

 Installation
 ------------
 
 Octave requires approximately 1.4 GB of disk storage to unpack and
 compile from source (significantly less, 400 MB, if you don't compile
 with debugging symbols).  Once installed, Octave requires
 approximately 350 MB of disk space (again, considerably less, 70 MB,
 if you don't build shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do
 not include debugging symbols).
 
-To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You
-will also need a recent version of g++ or another ANSI C++ compiler.
-You will also need a Fortran 77 compiler or f2c.  If you use f2c, you
-will need a script like fort77 that works like a normal Fortran
-compiler by combining f2c with your C compiler in a single script.
+To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of:
+
+- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
+- [GNU G++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or another C++11 compiler
+- [GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), another Fortran 77
+  compiler, or [f2c](http://www.netlib.org/f2c/)
 
-YOU MUST HAVE GNU MAKE TO COMPILE OCTAVE.  Octave's Makefiles use
-features of GNU Make that are not present in other versions of make.
-GNU Make is very portable and easy to install.
+Octave's Makefiles use features of GNU Make that are not present in
+other versions of make.  If you use `f2c`, you will need a script
+like `fort77` that works like a normal Fortran compiler by combining
+`f2c` with your C compiler in a single script.

-files in the etc directory of the Octave source distribution for more
-specific installation instructions.

 Bugs and Patches
 ----------------
 
-The file BUGS explains the recommended procedure for reporting bugs
-or contributing patches.
+The file `BUGS` explains the recommended procedure for reporting bugs
+on the [bug tracker](http://bugs.octave.org) or contributing patches.
 
 Documentation
 -------------
 
-Octave's manual has been revised for version 3.4, but it is lagging a
-bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is
-currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries.  If
-you notice omissions or inconsistencies, please report them on the
-bug tracker at http://bugs.octave.org.  Specific suggestions for ways
-to improve Octave and its documentation are always welcome.  Reports
-with patches are even more welcome.
+* [Octave's manual](https://www.octave.org/doc/interpreter/) is a
+  comprehensive user guide covering introductive and more advanced
+  topics.
+* [Octave's wiki](https://wiki.octave.org) is a user community page,
+  covering various topics and answering
+  [FAQ](https://wiki.octave.org/FAQ).
+* [Octave's Doxygen](https://www.octave.org/doxygen/) documentation
+  explains the C++ class libraries.
+
+Partially, the up-to-dateness of the documentation is lagging a bit
+behind the development of the software.  If you notice omissions or
+inconsistencies, please report them at our bug tracker.  Specific
+suggestions for ways to improve Octave and its documentation are
+always welcome.  Reports with patches are even more welcome.

-@mainpage Source code documentation for GNU Octave
-
-GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
-computations.  It provides a convenient interactive command line
-interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and
-for performing other numerical experiments.  It may also be used as a
-batch-oriented language for data processing.
-
-GNU Octave is free software. You may redistribute it and/or modify it
-under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">GNU
-General Public License</a> as published by the Free Software Foundation.
-
-This is the developer documentation for Octave's own source code. It is
-intended to help for hacking Octave. It may also be useful for
-understanding the Octave API when writing your own .oct files.
