 Since July 1996, most work on Octave has been done using a Linux
 system, and a number of people who regularly test Octave snapshot

+releases also primarily use Linux systems.  Because of this, I believe
+Octave should run reasonably well on most current Linux systems.
+However, there have been some problems in the past, usually the result
+of improper installation of compilers or libraries.  Sometimes the
+problems have happened because of a botched upgrade or even a buggy
+Linux distribution.
 
-However, I have recently started to receive a significant number of
-reports from people who say that they can't compile or run Octave on
-Linux systems.  In nearly every case, the problem has turned out
-to be that the compilers or libraries have not been installed
-properly.  I suspect that this often results from a botched upgrade,
-or from attempting to install the compilers from the standard source
-distributions.  But in some cases, the cause has been a buggy Linux
-distribution.  Many of these problems go unnoticed because much of the
-software for Linux is written in C, not C++.
+If you can, you should probably install Octave from one of the binary
+distributions available from ftp.che.wisc.edu, or using one of the
+Debian or RPM packages that are available at other sites.  For
+example, Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@rosebud.sps.queensu.ca> maintains the
+Debian Octave package and usually has them ready within a day or so of
+new Octave releases.  They are available via the WWW at
+http://www.debian.org/Packages/dist/math/octave.html.

+If for some reason you can't (or choose not to) install Octave from
+one of the binary distributions or by using one of the Debian or RPM
+packages and something goes wrong, please check the following list to
+see if your problem is already well known before reporting a bug.
 
 Octave compiles, but it won't run
 ---------------------------------
 
 If you can compile Octave, but it crashes with a segmentation fault
 right away, you probably have incompatible versions of libc and libg++
 installed, or you have a version of the dynamic loader, ld.so, that is
 incompatible with your versions of the libraries, or both.
 
-On my development system, I am using the following software:
-
-  * Linux kernel 2.0.6
-  * gcc/g++ 2.7.2
-  * g77 0.5.18
-  * libg++/libstdc++ 2.7.1.0
-  * libm 5.0.5
-  * libc 5.2.18
-  * libncurses 3.0
-  * ld.so 1.7.14
-  * binutils 2.6
-
-I know from experience that the versions listed above seem to work
-well together.  But if you have a newer version of the kernel, you may
-need a newer version of the C library.  I don't have time to keep up
-with all the various library versions (life is much too short for
-that), nor do I know which combinations are supposed to work together.
-That sort of information should be clearly stated in the release notes
-for the libraries.  If it is not, please ask the maintainers of the
-libraries to clarify the documentation.
-
-Please note that I am NOT recommending that everyone running Linux and
-using Octave should install the same versions of the libraries and
-compilers that I have.  I am simply saying that the versions listed
-above work for me.  Other version combinations may also work, but I
-don't have time to map out all the possibilities...

-Craig Earls <cpearls@ziplink.net> reports that the order of installing
-libc and lig++ is important.  If libg++ is installed *first*, Octave
-will work, but if the libraries are installed in the reverse orfer,
-Octave fails.  The conflict apparently arises because libc and libg++
-shared libraries both use libio, however no one seems to be able to
-provide a clear explanation of exactly what is happening.

 Octave won't even compile
 -------------------------
 
 If you can't compile Octave, you should first check to see that your
 compiler and header files are properly installed.  Do you have
 multiple versions of the g++ include files on your system?  Are you
 sure that your copy of g++ is finding the right set?  You can find out
 by compiling a simple C++ program with -v:

 Problems with g77 on Debian 1.2 systems (and possibly others)

 The location of the compiler binaries has changed, so the g77 0.5.18
 package can not be used without modification.  The problem is that the
 Debian package was built for gcc 2.7.2 and not 2.7.2.1 and the f771
 backend is installed in the wrong directory.

 Installing libg++ on a Linux system is not as simple as it should be,
 because libg++ shares some basic I/O code with the Linux C library,

 notes for the compiler and libraries.

 I/O in dynamically loaded .oct files doesn't work
 -------------------------------------------------
 
 If Octave prints things like `%.-1e' instead of numbers when you use a
 dynamically linked .oct file, you probably need to create shared
 versions of the Octave libraries.  To do that, configure Octave with
