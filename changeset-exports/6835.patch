       both for the same plot.
 
     + Plot property values are not extensively checked.  Specifying
       invalid property values may produce unpredictible results.

+    + Octave now sends data over the same pipe that is used to send
       commands to gnuplot.  While this avoids the problem of
       cluttering /tmp with data files, it is no longer possible to use
       the mouse to zoom in on plots.  This is a limitation of gnuplot,
       which is unable to zoom when the data it plots is not stored in
