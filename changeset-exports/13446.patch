 Quint is using the QTermWidget to emulate a terminal, this enabling readline support for Octave. This is the original README file from the author:

 QTermWidget
 version 0.1.0
 
 QTermWidget is an opensource project based on KDE4 Konsole application.
 The main goal of this project is to provide unicode-enabled, embeddable
 QT widget for using as a built-in console (or terminal emulation widget).
 
 Of course I`m aware about embedding abilities of original Konsole,

 The original Konsole`s code was rewritten entirely with QT4 only; also I have to
 include in the project some parts of code from kde core library. All code dealing
 with user interface parts and session managers was removed (maybe later I bring it
 back somehow), and the result is quite useful, I suppose.
 
 This library was compiled and tested on three linux systems,
 based on 2.4.32, 2.6.20, 2.6.23 kernels, x86 and amd64.
 Please inform about its behaviour on other systems.

+If you cannot launch Quint because it fails to find octave's shared libraries and you are sure that you have them installed, you will need
+to do an
+
+export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/octave-x.x.x/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH && bin/Quint
+
+and replace x.x.x by the specific octave version you have installed to run Quint. If you don't want to do that each time you launch Quint,
+do the following:
+
+sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf 
+
+and append the line:
+
+/usr/lib/octave-x.x.x/
+
+Save the file and do:
+
+sudo ldconfig
+
+Now Quint should not complain about missing shared libraries. If you have any problems, suggestions or ideas, feel free to drop me a mail at
