 You can use an assignment anywhere an expression is called for.  For
 example, it is valid to write @code{x != (y = 1)} to set @code{y} to 1
 and then test whether @code{x} equals 1.  But this style tends to make
 programs hard to read.  Except in a one-shot program, you should rewrite
 it to get rid of such nesting of assignments.  This is never very hard.
