 The Delaunay triangulation is constructed from a set of
 circum-circles. These circum-circles are chosen so that there are at
 least three of the points in the set to triangulation on the
 circumference of the circum-circle. None of the points in the set of
 points falls within any of the circum-circles.
 
 In general there are only three points on the circumference of any
-circum-circle. However, in the some cases, and in particular for the
+circum-circle. However, in some cases, and in particular for the
 case of a regular grid, 4 or more points can be on a single
 circum-circle. In this case the Delaunay triangulation is not unique. 
 
 @DOCSTRING(delaunay)
 
 The 3- and N-dimensional extension of the Delaunay triangulation are
 given by @code{delaunay3} and @code{delaunayn} respectively.  
 @code{delaunay3} returns a set of tetrahedra that satisfy the
