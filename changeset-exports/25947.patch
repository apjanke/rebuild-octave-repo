 @cindex opengl rendering slow windows
 
 On Windows platforms, Octave uses software rendering for the OpenGL graphics
 toolkits (@qcode{"qt"} and @qcode{"fltk"}) by default.  This is done to avoid
 rendering and printing issues due to imperfect OpenGL driver implementations
 for diverse graphic cards from different vendors.  As a down-side, software
-rendering might be considerably slower than hardware accelerated rendering. 
+rendering might be considerably slower than hardware accelerated rendering.
 To permanently switch back to hardware accelerated rendering with your graphic
 card drivers, rename the following file while Octave is closed:
 
 @file{@var{octave-home}\bin\opengl32.dll}
 @*where @var{octave-home} is the directory in which Octave is installed (the
 default is @file{C:\Octave\Octave-@var{version}}).
