doc: Rewrite parts of Introduction chapter.

* intro.txi: Add more info on GUI and IDE.  Remove information about function
type which is no longer part of help text.  Add @w{} around some text to prevent
it being broken up oddly in the output.  Update example help text for diary to
reflect the actualy texinfo.  Re-wrap lines to 72 characters.

+GNU Octave is a high-level language primarily intended for numerical
 computations.  It is typically used for such problems as solving
 linear and nonlinear equations, numerical linear algebra, statistical
 analysis, and for performing other numerical experiments.  It may also
 be used as a batch-oriented language for automated data processing.
 
-Until recently GNU Octave provided a command-line interface only with
-graphical plots displayed in separate windows.  However, by default
-the current version runs with a graphical user interface.
+The current version of Octave executes in a graphical user interface
+(GUI).  The GUI hosts an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
+which includes a code editor with syntax highlighting, built-in
+debugger, documentation browser, as well as the interpreter for the

 @section Running Octave
 
 On most systems, Octave is started with the shell command @samp{octave}.
-This starts the graphical user interface (GUI).  The central window in
-the GUI is the Octave command-line interface.  In this window Octave
-displays an initial message and then a prompt indicating it is ready to
-accept input.  If you have chosen the traditional command-line interface
-then only the command prompt appears in the same window that was running
-a shell.  In any case, you can immediately begin typing Octave commands.

+commands.
 
 If you get into trouble, you can usually interrupt Octave by typing
 @kbd{Control-C} (written @kbd{C-c} for short).  @kbd{C-c} gets
 its name from the fact that you type it by holding down @key{CTRL} and
 then pressing @key{c}.  Doing this will normally return you to Octave's
 prompt.

 @subsection Elementary Calculations
 
 Octave can easily be used for basic numerical calculations.  Octave
 knows about arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/), exponentiation (^),
 natural logarithms/exponents (log, exp), and the trigonometric
 functions (sin, cos, @dots{}).  Moreover, Octave calculations work
 on real or imaginary numbers (i,j).  In addition, some mathematical
