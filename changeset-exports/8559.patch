-Subject: ANNOUNCE: Octave Version 2.0.11 released
-
-Octave version 2.0.11 is now available for ftp from ftp.che.wisc.edu
-in the directory /pub/octave along with diffs from the previous
-version.
-
-  -rw-r--r--   1 jwe  3625698 Feb 24 17:06 octave-2.0.11.tar.gz

-
-Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed.
-
-This is mostly a bug-fixing release, but there is an important
-user-visible change:
-
-  * There are two new built-in variables that control how global
-    variables are initialized.  If `initialize_global_variables' is
-    nonzero, global variables are initialized to the value of the
-    variable `default_global_variable_value'.  The default value of
-    `initialize_global_variables' is 0 (1 if you use --traditional)
-    and `default_global_variable_value' is undefined (the empty matrix
-    if you use --traditional).  The default settings are compatible
-    with versions of Octave before 2.0.10.
-
-
-Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
-numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
-
-Additional information is available on the WWW at
