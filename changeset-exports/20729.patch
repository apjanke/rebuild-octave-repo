Only warn of Magick quantum depth if less than 16 instead of 32.

* libinterp/dldfcn/__magick_read__.cc: we are currently warning users about
  limitations of their Magick if it was built with less than quantum depth 32.
  This is excessive, it is only useful for people with 32 bit images (few and
  hopefully knowledgeable enough to notice immediately) while scaring all the
  other users.
