 ## The fitted spline is returned as a piecewise polynomial, @var{pp}, and

 ## The splines are constructed of polynomials with degree @var{order}.
 ## The default is a cubic, @var{order}=3.  A spline with P pieces has
 ## P+@var{order} degrees of freedom.  With periodic boundary conditions
 ## the degrees of freedom are reduced to P.
