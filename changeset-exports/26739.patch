       points, *not* pixels.  This change was made for Matlab
       compatibility.  Compared to previous versions of Octave, some
       lines and markers will appear 4/3 larger.
 
     * The appearance of patterned lines (LineStyle = ":"|"--"|"-.") has
       been improved for small widths (LineWidth < 1.5 pixels) which is a
       common scenario.
 
+ ** Printing to EPS files now uses a tight bounding box ("-tight"
+    argument to print) by default.  This makes more sense for EPS
+    files which are normally embedded within other documents, and is
+    Matlab compatible.  If necessary use the "-loose" option to
+    reproduce figures as they appeared in previous versions of Octave.

  ** New functions added in Octave 6:

       verLessThan
 
  ** Deprecated functions.
 
     The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 6 and will
