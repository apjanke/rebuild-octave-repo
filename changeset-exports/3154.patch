+Instructions for installing Octave on Windows NT/95 systems using the
+beta 18 release of the gnu-win32 tools from Cygnus Support.
+
+1. Install the Cygnus gnu-win32 tools.  You only need the user tools,
+   but you can install the full development kit instead (either will
+   work -- the development kit contains all the user tools plus the
+   GNU compilers and other development tools that are not needed to
+   just run Octave).  The gnu-win32 tools are available from
+   ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/latest, and also from
+   ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave/BINARIES/gnu-win32.
+
+     -- Download usertools.exe or cdk.exe.
+
+     -- Install the tools by running the file usertools.exe (or
+        cdk.exe) and following the directions.  The default install
+        location is /gnuwin32/b18 (the rest of the examples in this
+        document assume that you've used the default location).
+
+     -- Create a /bin directory and put a copy of sh.exe there.  You
+        can find the sh.exe file in /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin.
+
+     -- Create a /tmp directory.
+
+     -- Add
+
+          C:\gnuwin32\b18\H-i386-cygwin32\bin 
+
+        to your $PATH.
+
+     -- Create a /etc directory and put a copy of the termcap file
+        there.  You can find a suitable termcap file in the directory
+        /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/etc.
+
+     -- There is a bug in the main gnu-win32 dll that will cause
+        Octave to fail.  You need to fix it by either editing the file
+        (using an editor like Emacs that can handle binary files) or
+        by replacing it with the file cygwin-setpwent-fixed.dll from
+        ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave/BINARIES/gnu-win32.
+
+        To fix the problem by editing the file, open the file
+        /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/cygwin.dll and replace the
+        string setpwend with setpwent.  This change needs to be made
+        in three places in the same file.  Next, copy the fixed file to
+        /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/i386-cygwin32/lib/cygwin.dll.
+
+        To fix the problem by replacing the file with a version that's
+        already been fixed, download the file cygwin-setpwent-fixed.dll
+        from ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave/BINARIES/gnu-win32 and
+        copy it to /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin/cygwin.dll and
+        /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/i386-cygwin32/lib/cygwin.dll.
+
+2. Install less for gnuwin32.  A copy is available from
+   ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave/BINARIES/gnu-win32
+
+     -- Download the file less-gnu-win32.tar.gz.
+
+     -- Install it along with the gnu-win32 tools.  Change your
+        directory to /gnuwin32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/bin and untar the
+        less-gnu-win32.tar.gz file (bash syntax):
+
+          tar zxf /path/to/less-gnu-win32.tar.gz
+
+     -- Set the environment variable TERM to linux.
+
+3. Install Octave.
+
+     -- Download the file octave-2.0.10-i386-pc-cygwin32.tar.gz from 
+        ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave/BINARIES/gnu-win32.
+
+     -- Untar the distribution:
+
+          tar zxf octave-2.0.10-i386-pc-cygwin32.tar.gz
+
+        The files will be unpacked into a subdirectory called
+        octave-2.0.10-i386-pc-cygwin32.
+
+     -- Change your directory to octave-2.0.10-i386-pc-cygwin32 and
+        install the files using the command ./install-octave (running
+        bash).
+
+     -- The default installation directory is /octave.  If you choose
+        a different installation directory, you will have to set the
+        environment variable OCTAVE_HOME to the name of that directory
+        (using Unix file name syntax) in order for Octave to work.
+
+     -- Add C:\octave\bin to your path.
+
+     -- Set the environment variable TERM to linux.
+
+     -- Optionally set the environment variables HOME (for your home
+        direoctory using Unix file name syntax) and USER (for your user
+        name).
+
+Note that Octave requires gnuplot for plotting, but the normal Windows
+version of gnuplot will not work because it only reads from the GUI
+and refuses to read input from stdin.  Mumit Khan has written a patch
+that fixes the problem, but the gnuplot license does not allow us to
+distribute modified versions of gnuplot in binary form.  The patch is
+available from http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32.

-but it is usable.  If you would like to volunteer to work on

+Octave has been ported to Windows NT and Windows 95 using the beta 18
+release of the Cygnus gnu-win32 tools.  If you would like to volunteer
+to work on improving this port, please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
+
+The directory ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave/BINARIES/gnu-win32
+contains a binary distribution of Octave for Windows NT/95 along with
+installation instructions.  Unless you are interested in doing some
+hacking, you should use the binary releases.
 
 Here is a list of current problems (and workarounds, where available).
 
-* There is no binary version of Octave available for Windows NT or
-  Windows 95.  One will probably be released when the port is a little
-  more stable.
-
-* To compile and install Octave on a Windows NT or Windows 95 system,
-  you will need to get the beta 17 release of the GNU-WIN32 tools.  They
-  are available from ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32.
+* To compile and install Octave on a Windows NT/95 system,
+  you will need to get the beta 18 release of the gnu-win32 tools.
+  They are available from ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32.
 
-* There is a conflict between the files /cygnus/include/g++/String.h and
-  /cygnus/H-i386-cygwin32/i386-cygwin32/include/stringh.  You should
-  rename or remove /cygnus/include/g++/String.h.  (These file names
-  assume that you have installed the GNU-WIN32 tools in /cygnus).
+* There is a conflict between /gnu-win32/b18/include/g++/String.h
+  and /gnu-win32/b18/H-i386-cygwin32/i386-cygwin32/include/string.h.
+  You should rename or remove /gnu-win32/b18/include/g++/String.h.
+  (These file names assume that you have installed the gnu-win32 tools
+  in /gnu-win32/b18).
 
-* On Windows 95 systems, there is a bug that causes redirections to
-  /dev/null to fail.  You can work around the problem by substituting
-  /dev/nul for /dev/null in all of the files that use it.  (This
-  problem is fixed in the b17.1 release of the tools.)
-
-* You will need to have f2c and libf2c.a or g77 installed.  You can get
-  a copy of f2c from ftp://netlib.att.com/netlib/f2c.
+* You will need to have f2c and libf2c.a or g77 installed.  I would
+  recommend using g77.  Mumit Khan has directions for building g77 at
+  http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/g77.html.
+  Another solution is to use egcs, which includes g77.  The egcs
+  compiler is available from http://www.cygnus.com/egcs.
 
 * You will also need a termcap library.  The GNU termcap library seems
   to work.  You can get it from any GNU archive site, including 
-  ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/termcap-1.3.tar.gz.
-
-* GNU info doesn't work yet.  It compiles but doesn't run.  Perhaps the
-  problem is just that a proper termcap entry needs to be defined.
-
-* If no other pager can be found, Octave will use more.com.  Since
-  that's a pretty limited pager (no going backward, etc.) you may want
-  to find a working version of less.  The GNU-WIN32 tools used to
-  include a copy of less, but I am told it was dropped from the
-  distribution because it didn't work very well.  If you know of a
-  better port of less that will work with Octave, please contact
-  bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
+  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/termcap-1.3.tar.gz.
 
-* To make plotting work, you will need to find a version of gnuplot
-  that can read commands from a pipe.  The binary versions of gnuplot
-  for Windows that I found could only read from their command windows,
-  and wouldn't accept commands through a pipe, so they could not be
-  called from Octave.
-
-  After deleting -DREADLINE from the Makefile, I was able to compile a
-  working version of gnuplot 3.6 beta 315 using the GNU-WIN32 tools,
-  but it does not support the Windows graphics terminal.  It does
-  support dumb terminals and lots of other output devices, including
-  PostScript, but it would be much nicer if it could open a separate
-  window and draw pretty graphs there.
+* Octave requires gnuplot for plotting, but the normal Windows version
+  of gnuplot will not work because it only reads from the GUI and refuses
+  to read input from stdin.  Mumit Khan has written a patch that fixes
+  the problem, but the gnuplot license does not allow us to distribute
+  modified versions of gnuplot in binary form.  The patch is available
+  from http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32.
 
 * If Octave takes a long time to find function files, you may have to
   modify your LOADPATH to avoid device names specified using the
-  `//DEV/sudir' syntax.  To map the D: drive (for example) to
+  `//DEV/subdir' syntax.  To map the D: drive (for example) to
   /D_DRIVE, do the following:
 
     cd /
     mkdir /D_DRIVE
     mount d: /D_DRIVE
 
   Then you can set your LOADPATH to include /D_DRIVE/subdir instead of
   //d/subdir.
 
 If you know of solutions for any of the problems mentioned above,
 please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
