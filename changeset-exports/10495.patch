   o Use the "minimalist approach" for patches.  That is, each patch
     should address only one particular bug, new feature, etc.  Do not
     save up many unrelated changes and submit them all in one big
     patch, since in general, the larger the patch the more difficult
     it is for me to decide if the patch is either correct or
     desirable.
 
   o Submit a sample ChangeLog entry with your patch.  See the
     existing Octave ChangeLog for examples of what a ChangeLog entry
     should look like.
