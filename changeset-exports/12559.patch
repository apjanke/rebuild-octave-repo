 The ChangeLog entries should describe what is changed, not why.  Any
 explanation of why a change is needed should appear as comments in the
 code, particularly if there is something that might not be obvious to
 someone reading it later.
 
+When submitting code which addresses a known bug on the Octave bug tracker
+(@url{http://bugs.octave.org}), please add '(bug #XXXXX)' to the ChangeLog 
+and Mercurial commit messages.  Example:
