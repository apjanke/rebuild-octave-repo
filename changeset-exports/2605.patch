 * You will also need a termcap library.  The GNU termcap library seems
   to work.  You can get it from any GNU archive site, including 
   ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/termcap-1.3.tar.gz.
 
 * GNU info doesn't work yet.  It compiles but doesn't run.  Perhaps the
   problem is just that a proper termcap entry needs to be defined.
 
-* If you have a working version of less, the pager will probably work.
-  The GNU-WIN32 tools used to include a copy of less, but I am told it

 * To make plotting work, you will need to find a version of gnuplot
   that can read commands from a pipe.  The binary versions of gnuplot
   for Windows that I found could only read from their command windows,
   and wouldn't accept commands through a pipe, so they could not be
   called from Octave.
