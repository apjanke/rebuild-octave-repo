  ** Improved array indexing.
 
     The underlying code used for indexing of arrays has been
     completely rewritten and so the indexing of arrays is now
     significantly faster.
 
+ ** Improved performance for reduction operations.
+
+    The performance of the sum, prod, sumsq, cumsum, and cumprod
+    functions has been significantly improved.
+
  ** Diagonal and permutation matrices.
 
     The interpreter can now treat diagonal and permutation matrices as
     special objects that store only the non-zero elements, rather than
     general full matrices.  Therefore, it is now possible to construct
     and use these matrices in linear algebra without suffering a
     performance penalty due to storing large numbers of zero elements.
