 However, there have been some problems in the past, usually the result
 of improper installation of compilers or libraries.  Sometimes the
 problems have happened because of a botched upgrade or even a buggy
 Linux distribution.
 
 If you can, you should probably install Octave from one of the binary
 distributions available from ftp.che.wisc.edu, or using one of the
 Debian or RPM packages that are available at other sites.  For

 A binary release of g77 that should work with gcc 2.7.2 is available
 from sunsite.unc.edu in the directory /pub/Linux/devel/lang/fortran.
 There is also a Debian package for g77.  Also, g77 is now included as
 part of egcs (http://www.cygnus.com/egcs).
 
 Problems with g77 on Debian 1.2 systems (and possibly others)

-The location of the compiler binaries has changed, so the g77 0.5.18
+Your best bet is to upgrade to Debian 1.3 (or some newer version).
+If you choose not to do that, here are some old tips for working
+around the problem.
+
+The location of the compiler binaries changed, so the g77 0.5.18
 package can not be used without modification.  The problem is that the
 Debian package was built for gcc 2.7.2 and not 2.7.2.1 and the f771
 backend is installed in the wrong directory.
 
 Version 0.5.19 of g77 has just been released.  A fixed Debian package
 may be made available soon.  Until then, you can make things work by
 copying f771 and libf2c.a from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2 to
 /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2.1.
