+<title> Preface to the Octave Manual </title>
+</head>
+
+<body>
+<h2>Preface</h2>
+<p>
+Octave was originally intended to be companion software for an
+undergraduate-level textbook on chemical reactor design being written by
+James B. Rawlings of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and John
+G. Ekerdt of the University of Texas.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Clearly, Octave is now much more than just another `courseware' package
+with limited utility beyond the classroom.  Although our initial goals
+were somewhat vague, we knew that we wanted to create something that
+would enable students to solve realistic problems, and that they could
+use for many things other than chemical reactor design problems.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+There are those who would say that we should be teaching the students
+Fortran instead, because that is the computer language of engineering,
+but every time we have tried that, the students have spent far too much
+time trying to figure out why their Fortran code crashes and not enough
+time learning about chemical engineering.  With Octave, most students
+pick up the basics quickly, and are using it confidently in just a few
+hours.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Although it was originally intended to be used to teach reactor design,
+it has been used in several other undergraduate and graduate
+courses in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of
+Texas, and the math department at the University of Texas has been using
+it for teaching differential equations and linear algebra as well.  If
+you find it useful, please let us know.  We are always interested to
+find out how Octave is being used in other places.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Virtually everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do with
+music, but it is actually the name of a former
+<a href="http://www.engr.orst.edu/~reed/CSTR/profs.html">professor</a>
+of mine who wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction engineering,
+and who was also well known for his ability to do quick `back of the
+envelope' calculations.  We hope that this software will make it
+possible for many people to do more ambitious computations just as
+easily.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Everyone is encouraged to share this software with others under the
+terms of the
+<a href="cgi-bin/info2www?(octave)Copying">GNU General Public License</a>
+as described at the beginning of this manual.  You are also encouraged
+to help make Octave more useful by writing and contributing additional
+functions for it, and by reporting any problems you may have.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Many people have already contributed to Octave's development.  In
+addition to John W. Eaton, the following people have helped write parts
+of Octave or helped out in various other ways.
+</p>

+<li><em>Teresa Twaroch</em> (twaroch@ci.tuwien.ac.at) provided the functions
+<tt>gls</tt> and <tt>ols</tt>.</li>
+
+<li><em>Fook Fah Yap</em> (ffy@eng.cam.ac.uk) provided the <tt>fft</tt> and
+<tt>ifft</tt> functions and valuable bug reports for early versions.
+</ul>
+
+<p>
+Special thanks to the following people and organizations for
+supporting the development of Octave:
+</p>
+
+<ul>
+<li><em>Digital Equipment Corporation</em>, for an equipment grant as part
+of their External Research Program.</li>

+<title> Octave -- a high-level language for numerical computations </title>
+</head>
+
+<h3>Copyright (C) 1996 John W. Eaton</h3>
+
+<h4>Overview</h4>
+<p>
+Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
+computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
+solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Octave is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
+under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
+Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) any
+later version.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+Octave is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
+ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
+FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the file COPYING for more
+details.
+</p>
+
+<h4>Availability</h4>
+<p>
+The latest released version of Octave is always available via
+anonymous ftp from <a href="ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave">
+ftp.che.wisc.edu</a> in the directory /pub/octave.
+Complete source and binaries for several popular systems are
+available.
+</p>
+
+<h4>Installation and Bugs</h4>
+<p>
+Octave requires approximately 25MB of disk storage to unpack and
+install (significantly 	less if you don't compile with debugging
+symbols).  In order to build Octave, you will need a current version
+of g++, libg++, and GNU make.  Octave is known to compile on the
+following systems:
+</p>
+
+<ul>
+<li>SPARCstation 2 SunOS 4.1.2</li>
+<li>IBM RS/6000 AIX 3.2.x</li>
+<li>DECstation 5000/240 Ultrix 4.2a</li>
+<li>i486 Linux</li>
+<li>i486 NetBSD (without IEEE floating point support)</li>
+<li>HP 9000/7xx HP-UX 9.x</li>
+<li>SGI Irix 4.04</li>
+<li>NeXT NeXTStep ?</li>
+</ul>
+
+<p>
+See the notes in the files INSTALL and INSTALL.OCTAVE for more
+specific installation instructions, including directions for
+installing Octave from a binary distribution.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+The file BUGS contains a recommended procedure for reporting bugs, as
+well as a list of known problems.
+</p>
+
+<h4>Binary Distributions</h4>
+<p>
+Binary copies of Octave are now distributed for several popular Unix
+systems.  To save disk space, the complete source code for Octave is
+no longer included with the binary distribution, but should be
+available in the same place as the binaries.  If not, please contact
+bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+The file INSTALL.OCTAVE contains specific installation instructions,
+for installing Octave from a binary distribution.
+</p>
+
+<h4>Implemenation</h4>
+<p>
+Octave is being developed with the Free Software Foundation's make,
+bison (a replacement for YACC), flex (a replacement for lex), gcc/g++,
+and libg++ on a SPARCstation II and a DECstation 5000/240.  It should
+be possible to install it on any machine that runs GCC/G++.  It may
+also be possible to install it using other implementations of these
+tools, but it will most certainly require much more work.  Do yourself
+a favor and get the GNU development tools, either via anonymous ftp
+from prep.ai.mit.edu or by writing the Free Software Foundation, 675
+Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
+like Lapack, Linpack, Odepack, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
+of C++ classes (see the files in the libcruft and liboctave
+subdirectories).  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
+with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
+functions.  If that's not possible, they are translated with f2c and
+compiled with a C compiler.  Better performance is usually achieved if
+the intermediate translation to C is avoided.
+</p>
+
+<p>
+The library of C++ classes may also be useful by itself.
