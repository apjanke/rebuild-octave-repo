 Summary of important user-visible changes for version 3.8:
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
- ** strsplit has been modified to be compatible with Matlab.  There
-    are two instances where backward compatibility is broken.

-    (1) Delimiters are now string vectors, not scalars.

-       [1,2] = 3
-      }
-
-    (2) By default, Matlab treats consecutive delimiters are as a single
-    delimiter.  By default, Octave's legacy behavior was to return an
-    empty string for the part between the delmiters.
-
-    Where the legacy behavior is desired, the call to strsplit() may be
-    replaced by ostrsplit(), which is Octave's original implementation of
-    strsplit().

  ** Octave now supports nested functions with scoping rules that are
     compatible with Matlab.  A nested function is one declared and defined
     within the body of another function.  The nested function is only
     accessible from within the enclosing function which makes it one
     method for making private functions whose names do not conflict with those
     in the global namespace (See also subfunctions and private functions).
     In addition, variables in the enclosing function are visible within the
     nested function.  This makes it possible to have a pseudo-global variable

  ** Warning IDs renamed:
 
     Octave:array-as-scalar => Octave:array-to-scalar
     Octave:array-as-vector => Octave:array-to-vector
 
- ** The colormap function now provides new options--"list", "register",
-    and "unregister"--to list all available colormap functions, and to
-    add or remove a function name from the list of known colormap
-    functions.  Packages that implement extra colormaps should use these
-    commands with PKG_ADD and PKG_DEL statements.
-
  ** The m-files in the image directory have been overhauled.
 
     The principal benefit is that Octave will now no longer automatically
     convert images stored with integers to doubles.  Storing images as uint8
     or uint16 requires only 1/8 or 1/4 the memory of an image stored using
     doubles.  For certain operations, such as fft2, the image must still be
     converted to double in order to work.
 
     Other changes include fixes to the way indexed images are read from a
     colormap depending on the image class (integer images have a -1 offset to
     the colormap row number).

  ** The datevec function has been extended for better Matlab compatibility.
     It now accepts string inputs in the following numerical formats: 12, 21,
     22, 26, 29, 31.  This is undocumented, but verifiable, Matlab behavior.
     In addition, the default for formats which do not specify a date is
     January 1st of the current year.  The previous default was the current day,
     month, and year.  This may produce changes in existing scripts.
