 of the non-zero elements of the matrix must equally be stored. 
 
 An obvious way to do this is by storing the elements of the matrix as
 triplets, with two elements being their position in the array 
 (rows and column) and the third being the data itself.  This is conceptually
 easy to grasp, but requires more storage than is strictly needed.
 
 The storage technique used within Octave is the compressed column
-format.  In this format the position of each element in a row and the
-data are stored as previously.  However, if we assume that all elements
-in the same column are stored adjacent in the computers memory, then
-we only need to store information on the number of non-zero elements
-in each column, rather than their positions.  Thus assuming that the
-matrix has more non-zero elements than there are columns in the
-matrix, we win in terms of the amount of memory used.

 In fact, the column index contains one more element than the number of
 columns, with the first element always being zero.  The advantage of
 this is a simplification in the code, in that there is no special case
 for the first or last columns.  A short example, demonstrating this in
 C is.

 All of the solvers above, can calculate an estimate of the condition
 number.  This can be used to detect numerical stability problems in the
 solution and force a minimum norm solution to be used.  However, for
 narrow banded, triangular or diagonal matrices, the cost of
 calculating the condition number is significant, and can in fact
 exceed the cost of factoring the matrix.  Therefore the condition
 number is not calculated in these cases, and Octave relies on simpler
