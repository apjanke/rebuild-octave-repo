  ** The global error_state variable in Octave's C++ API has been
     deprecated and will be removed in a future version.  Now the error
     and print_usage functions throw an exception
     (octave_execution_exception) after displaying the error message.
     This makes the error and print_usage functions in C++ work more like
     the corresponding functions in the scripting language.
 
+ ** The default error handlers in liboctave have been updated to use
+    exceptions.  After displaying an error message they no longer return
+    control to the calling program.  The error handler function can be
+    customized through the global variables "current_liboctave_error_handler"
+    and "current_liboctave_error_with_id_handler".  If a programmer has
+    installed their own custom error handling routines when directly linking
+    with liboctave then these must be updated to throw an exception and
+    not return to the calling program. 
+
  ** New configure option, --enable-address-sanitizer-flags, to build
     Octave with memory allocator checks (similar to those provided by
     valgrind) built in.
