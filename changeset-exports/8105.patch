+Starting with version 3.0.1, Octave is once again part of the normal
+net distribution of Cygwin, available from http://www.cygwin.com.  
+The latest previous version available was 2.1.73

+It is possible to build Octave on Windows systems with Cygwin,
+but with standard gcc-3.4.4-3 compiler there are some performance
+problems related to the way C++ exception handling is implemented.
+This is a known problem with a long history so it is suggested to use

+Binary version 3.0.2-2 is built with gcc-4.3.2-1

 An obsolete version of Octave (2.1.73) is part of the normal net
 distribution of Cygwin, available from http://www.cygwin.com.  Check
 the package list in Cygwin's setup.exe installer if you would like to
 try using it.  However, 2.1.73 is unsupported and we STRONGLY
 recommended that you use a more recent version of Octave.
 
 It should be possible to build Octave on Windows systems with Cygwin,
 but at the time of this writing, there are some performance problems
 related to the way C++ exception handling is implemented with the
 default Cygwin compiler.  This is a known problem with a long history.
 If you would like to see this problem corrected, please search the
 Cygwin mailing lists for threads related to "sjlj exception handling"
 (or similar).
 
-There are also two "unofficial" Octave distributions for Cygwin:
+There is also an "unofficial" Octave distribution for Cygwin:
 
  1. http://www.geocities.jp/tmacchant
 
     The binaries here are built using gcc-3.4.4-3 configured with
     --disable-sjlj-exceptions.  Performance is improved by using DWARF
     exception handling instead of setjump/longjump exception
     handling.  However, to build dynamically loaded .oct files that
     will work with this version of Octave, you must use the same
     specially configured version of GCC that was used to build Octave
     itself and not the version of GCC that is distributed with
     Cygwin.
 
     This binary is maintained by Tatsuro Matsuroka.

-    The binaries here aim to be an officail cygwin distribution of
-    Octave-3.0.x and are built using the version of GCC distributed
-    with Cygwin.  Performance of linear algebra functions is fine, but
-    the performance of the scripting language interpreter suffers
-    because of the setjump/longjump exception handling model used in
-    the version of GCC distributed with Cygwin.  The advantage is that
-    you don't need a special version of GCC.

-    This binary is maintained by Marco Atzeri

-We hope that Cygwin will eventually have a version of GCC that does
-not suffer from the performance problem related to setjump/longjump
-exception handling.
