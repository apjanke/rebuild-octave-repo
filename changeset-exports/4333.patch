+.TH OTAGS 1 "31 October 2001" "GNU Octave"
+.SH NAME
+OTAGS - Generate Emacs tags file from GNU Octave code
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.BR otags\  [--include\ dir]
+\fIfile\fP .\|.\|.  
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.PP
+.B otags
+program is used to create a tag table file, in a format understood by 
+.BR emacs (1)
+and
+.BR xemacs (1).
+.B otags
+reads the files specified on the command line, and write a tag table  
+(defaults: `TAGS') in the current working directory. Files specified with
+relative file names will be  recorded in the tag table with file names
+relative to the directory where the tag table resides.  Files specified  with
+absolute file names will be recorded with absolute file names.
+
+The 
+.I --include
+option can be used to specify another directoy with Octave files for which
+tags shall be generated.
+ 
+Tags are generated for function names and for global variables. For
+global variables it doesn't work for more than one line global
+variables.  
+ 
+Tags are also created for lines of the form '###key foobar' so that
+you can jump to this specific place just by typing `M-. foobar'.
+Note that tags are not generated for scripts so that you have to add
+a line by yourself of the form `###key <script-name>' if you want to
+jump to it.
