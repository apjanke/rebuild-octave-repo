 ## The data matrix is given by @var{x}.  As usual, rows are observations
 ## and columns are variables.  The vector @var{g} specifies the
 ## corresponding group labels (e.g., numbers from 1 to @var{k}).

 ## The LR test statistic (Wilks' Lambda) and approximate p-values are

-## Three test statistics (Wilks, Hotelling-Lawley, and Pillai-Bartlett)
-## and corresponding approximate p-values are calculated and displayed.
-## (Currently NOT because the fcdf respectively betai code is too bad.)
+## The Hotelling-Lawley and Pillai-Bartlett test statistics are coded.
+## However, they are currently disabled until they can be verified by someone
+## with sufficient understanding of the algorithms.  Please feel free to
+## improve this.
