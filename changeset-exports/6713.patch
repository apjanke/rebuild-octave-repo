 ## Given two structs, arrange field names in @var{s1} as they appear

 ## Tell Octave to `hold' the current data on the plot when executing
 ## subsequent plotting commands.  This allows you to execute a series of
 ## plot commands and have all the lines end up on the same figure.  The
 ## default is for each new plot command to clear the plot device first.
 ## For example, the command
