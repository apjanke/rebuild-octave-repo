doc: Remove DOCSTRING references to non-existent functions (bug #49329).

* expr.txi: Remove DOCSTRING entries for allow_noninteger_range_as_index and
 do_braindead_shortcircuit_evaluation.

* grammar.txi: Remove mention of allow_noninteger_range_as_index.

 @section Calling Functions
 
 A @dfn{function} is a name for a particular calculation.  Because it has
 a name, you can ask for it by name at any point in the program.  For
 example, the function @code{sqrt} computes the square root of a number.
 
 A fixed set of functions are @dfn{built-in}, which means they are

 arguments because Octave would be forced to try to evaluate both of the
 operands for the operator @samp{&}.
 
 @sc{matlab} has special behavior that allows the operators @samp{&} and
 @samp{|} to short-circuit when used in the truth expression for @code{if} and
-@code{while} statements.  Octave also behaves the same way by default,

 Finally, the ternary operator (?:) is not supported in Octave.  If
 short-circuiting is not important, it can be replaced by the @code{ifelse}
 function.

 In addition, there are three non-specific parser customization functions.
 @code{add_input_event_hook} can be used to schedule a user function for
 periodic evaluation.  @code{remove_input_event_hook} will stop a user function
 from being evaluated periodically.
