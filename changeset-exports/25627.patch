@@ -10,16 +10,21 @@ Summary of important user-visible change
     with Matlab.  Change all uses of "ascending" and "descending" in
     existing code to the new options.
 
  ** Figure graphic objects have a new property "Number" which is
     read-only and will return the handle (number) of the figure.
     However, if the property "IntegerHandle" has been set to "off" then
     the property will return an empty matrix ([]).
 
+ ** Printing using the -dtiff output device will now create compressed
+    images using lzw compression.  This change was made for Matlab
+    compatibility.  To produce uncompressed images use the -dtiffn
+    device.
+
  ** The FFTW library is now required to perform FFT calculations.  The
     FFTPACK sources have been removed from Octave.
 
  ** The OSMesa library is no longer used.  To print invisible figures
     when using OpenGL graphics, the Qt QOFFSCREENSURFACE feature must be
     available and you must use the qt graphics toolkit.
 
  ** Deprecated functions.
