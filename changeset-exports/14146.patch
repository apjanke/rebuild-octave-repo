@@ -2,50 +2,88 @@ Starting with version 3.0.1, Octave is o
 net distribution of Cygwin, available from http://www.cygwin.com.  
 
 It is possible to build Octave from source on Windows systems with Cygwin,
 but with the old gcc-3.4.4-3 compiler there are some performance
 problems related to the way C++ exception handling is implemented.
 This is a known problem with a long history and it is STRONGLY 
 encouraged to use gcc-4.3.2-1 or later.
 
-Current binary versions are built with gcc-4.3.4-3 while 
-binary version 3.0.2-2 was built with gcc-4.3.2-1.
+Current binary versions are built with gcc-4.5.3-3.

-The latest development Octave development sources (octave-3.3.54+)
+------- SUGGESTED CONFIGURATION  ---------------------------
+
+The latest development Octave development sources (octave-3.5.91+)
 are built with:
 
 configure --enable-shared \
           --enable-float-truncate \
           CC=gcc-4 F77=gfortran-4 CXX=g++-4 CPP=cpp-4 
           lt_cv_deplibs_check_method=pass_all \
-          LDFLAGS=-no-undefined 
+          LDFLAGS=-Wl,-no-undefined 
 
 "--enable-float-truncate" is needed for the following bug:
 http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.octave.bugs/12361/focus=12404
 Without it, one of the quadgk test will fail as
 "a=a" could be false due to truncation problems with 
 complex numbers. 
 
 "lt_cv_deplibs_check_method=pass_all"  is needed to bypass
 incorrect libtool detection of system capabilities and
 to allow shared libs building.
 
+"LDFLAGS=-Wl,-no-undefined" is better than previous 
+"LDFLAGS=-no-undefined" as gcc-4 is now complaining about
+unknown command and the "undefined" is for the linker.
+
+The additional patch used for 3.4.3-3 package can also be 
+needed for 3.6.x (see below).
+
+------- SUGGESTION FOR FORK ISSUE --------------------------
+
+The build process can fails in building images for documentation 
+due to fork issue of the octave dll just built. In such case 
+I suggest to rebase the built dll's with:
+
+$ find build_tree -name "*.dll"  > rebase_list
+
+and after closing all cygwin process, from a dash shell
+
+$ rebaseall -s 'dll|so|oct' -T /full_path/rebase_list
+
+After rebasing the "make" should be able to complete the
+creation of the images and the documentation. 
+
+------------------------------------------------------ 
+
+Octave-3.4.3-3 package was built using:
+
+configure --libexecdir=/usr/lib \
+          --enable-shared \
+          --enable-float-truncate \
+          F77=gfortran-4 \
+          lt_cv_deplibs_check_method=pass_all \
+          LDFLAGS=-no-undefined    
+
+plus and additional patch to solve a specific cygwin 
+fltk print issue, see:
+https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?31641
 
 Octave-3.2.4 was built using:
 
 configure --enable-shared \
           --without-fltk \
           --without-framework-opengl \
           CC=gcc-4 F77=gfortran-4 CXX=g++-4 CPP=cpp-4
           CFLAGS="-Dtimezone=_timezone"
