  ** The determination of an object's dimensions, size, and shape by the
     functions ndims, rows, columns, isscalar, isvector, isrow, iscolumn,
     ismatrix, and issquare now fully depends on the function size.
     Thus, any user-defined object can ensure correct treatment by the
     aforementioned functions by properly overloading the "size"
     function.

  ** The strncmp and strncmpi functions now return true if the two input
     strings match, even though the number of characters specified by N
     exceeds the string length.  This behavior more closely matches
     common sense and is Matlab compatible.  Example:
 
-      Octave 5.0 : strncmp ("abc", "abc", 100) => true
+      Octave 5   : strncmp ("abc", "abc", 100) => true
       Previously : strncmp ("abc", "abc", 100) => false
 
  ** The intmax, intmin, and flintmax functions now accept a variable
     as input.  This supports a common programming usage which is to
     query the range of an existing variable.  Existing code can be
     simplified by removing the call to "class" that was previously
     required.  Example:
 
                    x = int8 (3);
-      Octave 5.0 : range = [ intmin(x), intmax(x) ]
+      Octave 5   : range = [ intmin(x), intmax(x) ]
       Previously : range = [ intmin(class(x)), intmax(class(x)) ]
 
  ** The ranks function has been recoded for performance and is now 25X
     faster.  In addition, it now supports a third argument that
     specifies how to resolve the ranking of tie values.
 
  ** The fsolve function has been tweaked to use larger step sizes when
     calculating the Jacobian of a function with finite differences.
