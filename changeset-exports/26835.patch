  ** The interpreter now supports handles to nested functions which was a
     long-standing incompatibility with Matlab.

     * Graphic primitives now accept a color property value of "none"
       which is useful when a particular primitive needs to be hidden
       (for example, the Y-axis of an axes object with "ycolor" = "none")
       without hiding the entire primitive ("visibility" = "off").
 
     * "LineWidth" and "MarkerSize" properties are now measured in
       points, *not* pixels.  This change was made for Matlab
       compatibility.  Compared to previous versions of Octave, some
